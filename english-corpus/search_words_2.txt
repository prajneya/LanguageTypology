Do they say (of the Prophet): "He has forged (the Qur 'an)?" Say: "Then bring ten Surahs like it, and call anyone except God to help you, if what you say is true."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He said: "O my people, think. If I have a clear proof from my Lord, and He has bestowed on me His grace, though unknown to you, can we force it upon you when you are averse?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I shall go up a mountain," he said, "which will keep me from the water." "There is no getting away," said Noah, "from the decree of God today, except for those on whom be His mercy." And a wave came between them, and he was among those who were drowned.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then it was said: "O earth, swallow back your water; and, O sky, desist." And the water subsided, and the decree was accomplished. The ark came to rest on Judi (Mount Ararat), and it was said: "Away with the cursed people!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So when Our angels came to Lot, he grieved for them, and felt powerless to help them, and said: "This is a day of sorrow.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this surely is a sign for him who fears the torment of the Hereafter, the day when mankind will be assembled together, which will be a day when all things would become evident.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not lean towards the wicked, or you will be caught in the flames of Hell, and have none to befriend you other than God, nor will you be given help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Be steadfast, for verily God does not let the reward of those who are upright and do good to go waste.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If only there had been men endued with virtue in the ages before you, who could preserve men from doing evil in the world, other than the few We saved from among them. Those who were wicked followed that which made them dissolute, and became sinners.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But if your Lord had pleased He could have made all human beings into one community of belief. But they would still have differed from one another,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let us kill Joseph or cast him in some distant land so that we may get our father 's exclusive affection; then play innocent. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They showed him the shirt with false blood on it. (Their father) said: "It is not so; you have made up the story. Yet endurance is best. I seek the help of God alone for what you impute."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They showed him the shirt with false blood on it. (Their father) said: "It is not so; you have made up the story. Yet endurance is best. I seek the help of God alone for what you impute."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A caravan happened to pass, and sent the water - carrier to bring water from the well. He let down his bucket (and pulled Joseph up with it). "What luck," said the man; "here is a boy;" and they hid him as an item of merchandise; but what they did was known to God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And (Joseph) asked the man he knew would be released: "Remember me to your lord;" but Satan made him forget to mention this to his lord, and Joseph remained in prison for a number of years.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And (Joseph) asked the man he knew would be released: "Remember me to your lord;" but Satan made him forget to mention this to his lord, and Joseph remained in prison for a number of years.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then the servant, who of the two had been released, remembering (Joseph), said: "I will give you its interpretation; let me go for it."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(At this Joseph remarked:) "From this (the Minister) should know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that God does not surely let the wiles of those who betray ever succeed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus We gave Joseph authority in the land so that he lived wherever he liked. We bestow Our favours on whomsoever We please, and do not allow the reward of those who are good to go waste.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they came to Joseph he made his brother his guest, and said: "I am your brother. So do not grieve for what they had done."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When he had given them their provisions he put his goblet in his brother 's saddle - bag. Then a crier announced: "O men of the caravan, you are thieves."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We cannot find the master 's goblet. Whoever comes up with it will be given a camel - load of grain; I vouch for it."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they despaired of (persuading) him, they went aside to confer. The oldest of them said: "You know that your father has pledged you in the name of God, and you have been guilty of iniquity in the case of Joseph before. I will not leave this place unless my father permits or God decides for me, for He is the best of all judges.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"No," said (the father). "You have made up the story; but patience is best; God may bring them back to me. He is all - knowing and all - wise."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The caravan departed (from Egypt) and Jacob said (at home): "Say not that I am in my dotage, but I get the smell of Joseph."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He seated his parents by his side on the throne; and they fell down before him in homage. "O my father," said Joseph, "this is the meaning of my earlier dream. My Lord has made it come true. He was gracious in getting me out of the prison, and bringing you out of the desert to me after the discord created by Satan between me and my brothers, for my Lord is gracious to whomsoever He please. He is indeed all - knowing and all - wise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O my Lord, you have given me dominion and taught me the interpretation of dreams; O Creator of the heavens and the earth, You alone are my saviour in this world and the world to come; let me die submitting to You, and place me among the upright. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the apostles despaired and thought they were made false promises, Our help arrived, and We delivered whom We pleased; but never will Our punishment be averted from the sinners.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who stretched the earth and placed upon it stabilisers and rivers; and made two of a pair of every fruit; (and) He covers up the day with the night. In these are signs for those who reflect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the earth are tracts adjoining one another, and vineyards, fields of corn and date - palm trees, some forked, some with single trunks, yet all irrigated by the self - same water, though We make some more excellent than the others in fruit. There are surely signs in them for those who understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who makes the lightning flash for fear and hope, and raises massive clouds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whosoever is in the heavens and on earth bows to God in submission with a will or perforce, as do their shadows in the morning and evening.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who keep together what God has ordained held together, and fear their Lord and dread the hardship of the Reckoning,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who keep together what God has ordained held together, and fear their Lord and dread the hardship of the Reckoning,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had there been a Qur 'an which could have made the mountains move, or the earth to cleave asunder, or the dead to speak, yet all authority belongs to God. Have the believers not learnt that if God had so willed He could have guided all mankind? As for unbelievers, they will be visited by misfortune endlessly for what they have done; or it would sit in their homes till the promised threat of God comes to pass. Surely God does not go back on His promise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many an apostle have they mocked before you; but I allowed the unbelievers respite, then I seized them. How severe was My punishment then!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who is it who stands (watch) over every soul for what it does? Yet they ascribe compeers to God. Say: "Then name them. Or are you announcing to God what He does not know on the earth? Or is it only empty talk? In fact, the unbelievers' plots are made to look attractive to them, so that they are held back from the right path. Whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whether We allow you to see (the punishment) We have promised them, or end your life before (its execution), it is certainly for you to convey the message; the reckoning is for Us to do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before him is Hell, and he will get putrid liquid to drink.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they will all appear before God together, the weak will say to those who were arrogant: "We were your followers, so can you now save us a little from God 's punishment?" They will say: "If we had been guided by God we would surely have shown you the way. To lament or endure is all the same to us now. No getting away is there for us."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the reckoning is over Satan will say: "The promise that was made to you by God was indeed a true promise; but I went back on the promise I had made, for I had no power over you except to call you; and you responded to my call. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. Neither can I help you nor can you give me help. I disavow your having associated me earlier (with God). The punishment for those who are wicked is painful indeed."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
With immutuble words God makes the faithful dauntless in the life of the world and the life to come, but leads the unjust into error, for God does as He pleases.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is God who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down rain from the sky producing fruits for your food thereby, and made you master of the ships that ply in the oceans by His command, subjected the rivers to your control,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember when Abraham prayed: "O Lord, make this a city of peace, and preserve me and my progeny from worshipping idols:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Think not God is oblivious of the deeds of the wicked. He has only allowed them respite till the Day on which all eyes would stare aghast,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Still they are plotting their plots, but evident are their plots to God, even though they are so adroit as to make the mountains move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Think not that God would go back on His promise (made) to the apostles. Indeed God is mighty, the Lord of retribution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will see the wicked on that day bound together in chains.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We stretched the earth and placed upon it firm stabilisers, and made all things grow upon it balanced evenly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Lord will surely gather them together: Certainly He is all - wise and all - knowing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We shall cast out any grudge they may have in their hearts. (There) they will sit on couches face to face like brothers together.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"So leave with your family late in the night, yourself remaining in the rear, and let none turn back to look, and go where you will be commanded."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He created the cattle from whom you get warm clothing and (other) advantages, and some you eat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
With which He makes crops grow, and olives, dates and grapes and fruits of every kind for you. In this is a sign for those who think.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even if you are eager to guide them, God does not surely guide those who have gone astray: They will have no one to help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For (they fear) He might make what they differed about plain to them, and that the infidels may realise that they were liars.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have the plotters of mischief become unafraid that God will not split the earth to swallow them, or that punishment will not fall upon them from somewhere they do not (even) suspect?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And hides from people for shame at the news, (at a loss) whether he should keep her with shame, or bury her in the ground. How bad is the judgement that they make!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
By God, We sent apostles to many a people before you, but Satan made their acts seem attractive to them, and he is their friend this day, and a painful torment awaits them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Lord predisposed the bees to make their hives in mountains, trees and trellices,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is God who creates you, then makes you die; and some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they had known before. God is indeed all - knowing and all - powerful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

God has given you homes to live in, and tents (made) from the hides of cattle convenient for days of travelling and halting; and from their wool and fur and hair you make domestic articles and goods that last a certain time.

The day We shall call a witness from every people, the unbelievers will not be allowed to make excuses.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day We shall call a witness from every people, the unbelievers will not be allowed to make excuses.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remind them of the Day when We shall call from every people a witness against them, and make you a witness over them, for We have revealed to you the Book as an exposition of everything, and as guidance and grace and happy tidings for those who submit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fulfil your covenant with God, having made the covenant, and do not break your oaths once you have sworn them, as you have made God a witness over you. Indeed God knows what you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fulfil your covenant with God, having made the covenant, and do not break your oaths once you have sworn them, as you have made God a witness over you. Indeed God knows what you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And do not be like her who untwists her yarn having spun it into durable thread. Do not use your oaths deceitfully because one party has ascendency over you. God surely tries you in this way: He will make it clear to you on the Day of Resurrection what you were differing about.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If God had pleased He would surely have made you a single community of belief; but He leads whosoever He wills astray, and guides whosoever He please. But you will surely be questioned about what you used to do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So do not make your oaths a means of deceiving one another, lest your foot should slip after having found its hold, and you taste of evil for having hindered (others) from the way of God, and suffer a grievous punishment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When We replace a message with another - - and God knows best what He reveals - - they say: "You have made it up;" yet most of them do not know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whosoever denies having once believed - - unless he is forced to do so while his heart enjoys the peace of faith - - and opens his mind to disbelief will suffer the wrath of God. Their punishment will be great,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not utter the lies your tongues make up: "This is lawful, and this is forbidden," in order to impute lies to God; for they who impute lies to God will not find fulfilment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Endure with patience, for your endurance is not without the help of God. Do not grieve for them, and do not be distressed by their plots.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We gave Moses the Book, and made it a guidance for the children of Israel that they should not take another protector apart from Me.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have created night and day as two signs, then We efface the sign of the night, and make the sign of the day resplendent that you may seek the bounty of your Lord, and know the computation of years and numbers. We have expounded most distinctly everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And do not touch the property of the orphans except for bettering it, until they come of age; and fulfil the promise made: You will surely be questioned about the promise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing could stop Us from sending signs except that the earlier people had rejected them as lies. We sent to Thamud the she - camel as a token to make it clear to them, but they treated her cruelly; and We send signs only to deter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(And) said: "Look! This is what you have honoured above me! If You defer (my term) till the Day of Resurrection, I will bring his progeny into complete subjugation, barring a few."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mislead any of them you may with your voice, attack them with your cavalry and soldiers on foot, share their wealth and children with them, and make promises to them. "- - But the promises of Satan are nothing but deceit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In that case We would have made you taste a double anguish of life and a double anguish of death, and then you would not have been able to find a helper against Us for yourself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Say: "Surely if men and jinns get together to produce the like of this (Qur 'an), they will not be able to produce the like of it, however they might assist one another.

Say: "Surely if men and jinns get together to produce the like of this (Qur 'an), they will not be able to produce the like of it, however they might assist one another.

And say: "We will not believe you until you make a spring of water gush forth from the earth for us;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or, let chunks of sky fall over us, as you assert (you will); or, bring God and the angels as a surety;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He is guided whom God guides. As for him He allows to go astray, you will not find a protector other than Him. We shall raise them on the Day of Resurrection in their own image, blind and dumb and deaf: Their habitation will be Hell. Every time (its fire) subsides We will intensify its flame.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
After this We told the children of Israel: "Dwell in the land. When the promise of reckoning comes, We shall bring you together from a motley crowd.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And say: "All praise be to God who has neither begotten a son nor has a partner in His kingdom; nor has He need of any one to protect Him from ignominy. So extol Him by extolling His majesty."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And that it may warn those who say: "God has begotten a son."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have made whatever exists on the earth its adornment to test and try them (and) know who acts better;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may have thought that they were awake, yet they were asleep. We made them turn right and left, while their dog lay with his forelegs stretched across the threshold. If you had looked at them you would have surely turned away and fled with horror at the sight.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even so We roused them that they may question one another. One of them asked: "How long have you stayed here?" They said: "A day or less than a day." "Your Lord knows best," they said, "how long you have stayed. So send one of you to the town with this money of yours to look for wholesome food and bring it for you; but he should be careful not to let your presence known.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If they come to know of you they will stone you to death, or force you to go back to their creed; then you will never succeed. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Without (adding), "if God may please;" and think of your Lord in ease you forget, and say: "Perhaps my Lord will show me a nearer way to rectitude."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Persevere with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His magnificence. Do not turn your eyes away from them, seeking the splendours of this world, and do not follow him whose heart We have made oblivious to Our remembrance, who follows his own lust and exceeds the bound.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "The truth is from your Lord: So believe if you like, or do not believe if you will." We have prepared for the sinners a fire which will envelope them in its tent. If they ask for water they will be helped to liquid like molten brass that would scald their mouths. How evil the drink, and evil the resting - place!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But surely We do not let the reward of those who believe and do the right to go waste.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There will be gardens of Eden for them, with rivers flowing by, where they will be decked in bracelets of gold, with silken robes of green and of brocades to wear, reclining on couches. How excellent the guerdon, and excellent the resting - place!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each of the gardens yielded its fruit and did not withhold the least; and We made a stream flow in between them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And he walked into his garden, and, (forgetting) his limit, said: "I cannot imagine that this will ever be ruined,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He had no body to help him other than God, nor was he able to save himself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Present to them the example of the life of this world so like the water We send down from the skies that mingles with the earth to nourish its vegetation, which then on the morrow turns to stubble and is blown away by the wind. God has power over everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day We shall move the mountains, and you see the earth an open plain, We shall gather them together, leaving none behind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation. I would not take as helpers those who lead (men) astray.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day He will say: "Call those you had called My compeers," they will call them, but will get no response, and We shall place a gulf between them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We never send apostles but to convey happy tidings, and to warn. But those who disbelieve contend with false arguments to nullify the truth. They make a mockery of My revelations and of what they had been warned.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who is more unjust than he who, on being reminded of his Lord 's revelations, turns away from them, and forgets the evil deeds he had committed in the past. Verily We have placed a covering on their hearts so that they do not understand, and a deafness in their ears so that however you may call them to guidance they will never be guided aright.

When they reached the confluence they forgot the fish (they had brought as food) which swiftly made its way into the sea.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they reached the confluence they forgot the fish (they had brought as food) which swiftly made its way into the sea.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So they set out till they (came to the quay) and went on board a ship in which he made a hole, (and Moses said:) "You have made a hole in the boat to drown its passengers? You have done a strange thing!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So they set out till they (came to the quay) and went on board a ship in which he made a hole, (and Moses said:) "You have made a hole in the boat to drown its passengers? You have done a strange thing!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Moses) said: "Do not hold me for having forgotten, and do not reprove me and make my task difficult."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That boat belonged to poor people who used to toil on the sea. I damaged it because there was a king after them who used to seize every ship by force.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But he who believes and does the right will have an excellent reward, and we shall make things easy for him. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He said: "The ability my Lord has given me is better. So help me with your manual labour; I will build a wall between you and them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bring me ingots of iron, "(which they did) until the space between two mountain sides was filled up." Blow your bellows, "he said; (and they blew) until it was red hot." Bring me molten brass, "he said," that I may pour over it. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We shall leave them on that day surging like waves pressing one against the other, and the trumpet blast will be sounded, when We shall gather them all together.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do the unbelievers think they can make My own creatures their protectors against Me? We have prepared Hell for the hospitality of infidels.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who will be heir to me, and heir to the house of Jacob; and make him obedient to You, O Lord. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He said: "Thus will it be. Your Lord said: 'It is easy for Me,' and that: 'We shall make him a sign for men and a blessing from Us.' This is a thing already decreed."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The birth pangs led her to the trunk of a date - palm tree. "Would that I had died before this," she said, "and become a thing forgotten, unremembered."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then (a voice) called to her from below: "Grieve not; your Lord has made a rivulet gush forth right below you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then (a voice) called to her from below: "Grieve not; your Lord has made a rivulet gush forth right below you.

"I am a servant of God," he answered. "He has given me a Book and made me a prophet,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And be dutiful to my mother. He has not made me haughty or rebellious.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus, when he left them and the (idols) they worshipped, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and made each of them a prophet,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We do not come down," (will the angels say) "but only by your Lord 's command." To Him belongs whatever lies before us and behind us, and the space in between. Your Lord does not ever forget:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
By your Lord, We shall gather them and the devils together, then bring them crawling on their knees around Hell.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is not one among you who will not reach it. Your Lord has made this incumbent on Himself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They say: "God has begotten a son."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We have made this (Qur 'an) easy in your tongue that you may give good news to those who take heed, and warn the people who are contentious.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So do not let those who do not believe in it and follow their vain desires, turn you away from it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And make my mission easy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So go to him and say: 'The two of us have indeed been sent by your Lord. So let the children of Israel come with us, and do not oppress them. We have come to you with a token from your Lord. Peace on him who follows the way of guidance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Moses) replied: "Knowledge of that is with my Lord (recorded) in the Book. My Lord neither errs nor forgets."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made the earth a bed for you, and traced for you paths upon it, and sends down water from the sky, and brings out through it every kind of vegetation

We shall certainly meet you with like magic. So make an appointment when we and you could meet on common ground, which neither we nor you should fail to keep. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Said (Moses): "Let your meeting be on the day of the Feast, and let people assemble in broad daylight."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throw down what is in your right hand: It will swallow up what they have conjured. For what they have fashioned is only a trick of the sorcerer; and a sorcerer does not succeed wherever he may come. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have certainly come to believe in our Lord that He may forgive our trespasses and the magic you have forced us to perform, for God is nobler and abiding. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and made a covenant with you on the right side of the Mount, and sent down for you manna and quails,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What made you hurry away, O Moses, from your people? "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Moses returned to his people full of anger and regret. "O my people," he said, "did not your Lord make you a better promise? Did the time of covenant seem too long to you? Or did you wish the wrath of your Lord to fall upon you that you broke the promise you had made to me?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Moses returned to his people full of anger and regret. "O my people," he said, "did not your Lord make you a better promise? Did the time of covenant seem too long to you? Or did you wish the wrath of your Lord to fall upon you that you broke the promise you had made to me?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They said: "We did not break our promise to you of our own will, but we were made to carry the loads of ornaments belonging to the people, which we threw (into the fire), and so did Sameri.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exalted then be God, the real King; and do not try to anticipate the Qur 'an before the completion of its revelation, but pray: "O Lord, give me greater knowledge."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We said; "O Adam, he is truly your enemy and your wife 's. Do not let him have you turned out of Paradise and come to grief.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(And) said: "Go down hence together, one the enemy of the other. Then will guidance come to you from Me; and whoever follows My direction will neither be disgraced nor be miserable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We did not make their bodies immune to hunger, nor were they immortal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then We made Our promise good to them and delivered whomsoever We pleased, and destroyed the transgressors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And this remained their lament till We mowed them down and made them extinct.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If We had pleased to make a plaything We could have made it Ourself, if We had cared to do so.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If We had pleased to make a plaything We could have made it Ourself, if We had cared to do so.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And yet they say: "Ar - Rahman has begotten a son." Too exalted is He! In fact, those (they call His sons) were His honoured votaries.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not these unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were an integrated mass, then We split them and made every living thing from water? Will they not believe even then?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We made the sky a well - protected roof. Still they turn away from His signs!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But when the unbelievers see you they make fun of you (and say): "Is this the one who mentions your gods (deridingly)?" Yet in Ar - Rahman they disbelieve!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Man is made of inordinate haste. We will show you Our signs, then you will not desire to hasten (the punishment).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If only the unbelievers could apprehend the moment when they would neither be able to ward off the fire from their faces and their backs, nor help reach them!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or do they have lords of their own besides Us who can defend them? But they are not able to help themselves, nor can they find protection against Us.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We allowed them and their fathers time to enjoy till the very end of their lives. Do they not see Us advancing into the land, reducing its frontiers? Would they still prevail?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They wished to entrap him, but We made them greater losers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We bestowed on him Isaac, and Jacob as an additional gift, and made them righteous.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We made them leaders to guide (the people) by Our command; and We inspired them to perform good deeds and observe their moral obligations and pay the zakat; and they obeyed Us.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We helped him against the people who rejected Our signs as lies. They were a wicked people indeed, so We drowned them one and all.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made Solomon understand the case, and bestowed on each wisdom and knowledge, We subdued the al - jibal (mountains) with David to sing Our praises, and at - tair (birds). It is We who did it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made tempestuous winds obedient to Solomon which blew swiftly to sail at his bidding (with his ships) to the land We had blessed. We are cognisant of everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And many of the devils (We also made obedient to him) who dived for him, and did many other things; and We kept watch over them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Remember) her who preserved her chastity, into whom We breathed a new life from Us, and made her and her son a token for mankind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verily you and those you worship other than God will be faggots for Hell; and come to it you will.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Judge in truth (between us), O Lord," he said. "Our Lord is merciful, whose help we seek against what you attribute."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day you see it every suckling female will forget her suckling, and every pregnant female will discharge her burden. You will see men drunk, yet it will not be intoxication. The torment of God will be severe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have any doubt, O men, about being raised to life again, (remember) that We created you from dust, then a drop of semen, then an embryo, then a chewed up lump of flesh shaped and shapeless, that We may reveal (the various steps) to you. We keep what We please in the womb for a certain time, then you come out as a child, then reach the prime of age. Some of you die, some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they knew, having known it once. You see the earth all withered, then We send down rain upon it, and it bestirs itself, swells, and brings forth every kind of beauteous verdure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Turning their backs that they may lead away from the path of God. For such there is disgrace in the world, and on the Day of Judgement We shall make them taste the torment of burning.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He who thinks that God will not help him in this world and the next should stretch a rope to the sky then cut it off and see if his mind is relieved (of doubts) by this stratagem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God will surely admit those who believe and do the right to gardens with rivers running by, where they will be decked in bracelets of gold and of pearls; and of silk will be their garments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let them then attend to their persons and complete the rites of pilgrimage, fulfil their vows and circuit round the ancient House.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apart from this, whoever respects the sacred ordinances of God, will find a better reward for him with his Lord. You are allowed to eat all cattle except those already mentioned to you. Avoid the repugnance of idols, and false and frivolous talk.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have made the camels signs of God for you. There is good for you in this. So pronounce the name of God over them as they stand with their forefeet in a line. When they have fallen (slaughtered) on their sides, eat of (their meat) and feed those who are content with little, and those who supplicate. That is why We have brought them under your subjugation so that you may be grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Permission is granted those (to take up arms) who fight because they were oppressed. God is certainly able to give help to those

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who were driven away from their homes for no other reason than they said: "Our Lord is God." And if God had not restrained some men through some others, monastries, churches, synagogues and mosques, where the name of God is honoured most, would have been razed. God will surely help those who help Him, - - verily God is all - powerful and all - mighty, - -

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the people of Midian too. Moses was also accused of lies. So I allowed the infidels respite and then seized them. How was My reprobation then!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many a habitation given to wickedness have We destroyed, whose roofs tumbled down, which fell into ruins. How many a well and fortress reinforced lie abandoned!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is in order to make the interpolations of Satan a test for those whose hearts are diseased and hardened: Surely the sinners have gone far in dissent.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whosoever retaliates to the extent of injury suffered by him, and is wronged again, will certainly be helped by God. Verily God is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who gives you life, then makes you die; then He will bring you back to life again. Man is surely most ungrateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yet they worship in place of God that for which no authority has been sent to them, and of which they have no knowledge. The wicked will have none to help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O men, give ear to this parable: Those you worship other than God can never create as much as a fly, even if they get together to do so; and if the fly were to rob them of a thing they would not be able to snatch it away from it. How weak the seeker and how weak the sought!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strive in the way of God with a service worthy of Him. He has chosen you and laid no hardship on you in the way of faith, the faith of your forbear Abraham. He named you Muslim earlier, and in this (Qur 'an), in order that the Prophet be witness over you, and you be witness over mankind. So be firm in devotion, pay the zakat, and hold on firmly to God. He is your friend: How excellent a friend is He, how excellent a helper!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made several highways one over the other above you. We are not neglectful of creation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"O my Lord," prayed (Noah), "help me against them, for they accuse me of lies."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then We sent Our apostles one after the other. Every time an apostle came to a people they denied him. So We made one follow the other (to its doom), and turned them into bygone tales. Cursed be the people who do not believe!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and gave them shelter on an elevated ground, sequestered, watered by a spring.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So that when We seize the affluent among them with affliction, they will begin to implore for help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Do not supplicate for help today; you will not be rescued by Us;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has not begotten a son, nor is there any god besides Him. Had this been so, each god would have taken away what he had created with him, and some would have risen over the others. God is much too glorious for what they attribute (to Him)!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "O Lord, if I am made to see what has been promised them,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have certainly the power to make you see what We have promised them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But you ridiculed them. So much so that out of (spite) for them you forgot to remember Me and laughed at them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WE HAVE REVEALED this Surah and made it obligatory as We have sent down clear injunctions in it that you may be warned.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, do not follow in the footsteps of Satan, for he who follows in the footsteps of Satan will be induced by him to what is shameful and forbidden. But for the grace of God and His mercy upon you none of you would have escaped undefiled; but God makes whosoever He will grow in goodness, for God is all - hearing and all - knowing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tell the believing women to lower their eyes, guard their private parts, and not display their charms except what is apparent outwardly, and cover their bosoms with their veils and not to show their finery except to their husbands or their fathers or fathers - in - law, their sons or step - sons, brothers, or their brothers' and sisters' sons, or their women attendants or captives, or male attendants who do not have any need (for women), or boys not yet aware of sex. They should not walk stamping their feet lest they make known what they hide of their Ornaments. O believers, turn to God, every one of you, so that you may be successful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who cannot afford to marry should abstain from what is unlawful until God enriches them by His grace. And free those slaves you possess who wish to buy their freedom after a written undertaking, if you know they have some goodness, and give them out of the riches God has given you. Do not force your maids to prostitution if they wish to lead married lives, in order to get the benefits of this world. But if someone forces them, surely God (will forgive them) after their forced helplessness, for He is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The light is lit) in houses of worship which God has allowed to be raised, and His name remembered in them. His praises are sung there morning and evening,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you not seen that God drives the clouds, then joins them together and puts them fold on fold. Then you see the rain fall through them; and He sends down hail from the sky where there are mountains of it, and strikes those with it whom He will, and wards it off from whomsoever He please. His lightning could snatch away their eyes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has promised to make those of you who believe and do the right, leaders in the land, as He had made those before them, and will establish their faith which He has chosen for them and change their fear into security. They will worship Me and not associate any one with Me. But those who disbelieve after this will be reprobates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, let your dependants and those who have not yet reached the age of puberty, ask permission (to enter your presence) on three occasions: Before the early morning prayer; when you disrobe for the mid - day siesta; and after prayer at night. These are the three occasions of dishabille for you. There is no harm if you or they visit one another at other times (without permission). God thus explains things to you clearly, for God is all - knowing and all - wise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no harm in your eating together or separately. But when you enter the houses, salute the inmates with a greeting in the name of God, invoking blessings and good health. That is how God explains things to you clearly so that you may understand. They alone are true believers who believe in God and His Apostle, and when they are with him on a matter of common concern, do not depart without obtaining his leave. Surely those who ask leave of you are the ones who believe in God and His Apostle. Therefore when they ask leave of you for personal business give leave to those you please, and seek God 's forgiveness for them. Surely God is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not consider your being summoned by the Apostle to be like your summoning one another. God knows those of you who go away surreptitiously. So let those who act in contravention of his command take heed lest a trial should befall them or a grievous punishment come upon them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, who has neither begotten a son nor has He a partner in His kingdom, (who) created everything and determined its exact measure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blessed be He who, if He pleased, could give you better than that, - - gardens with rivers flowing by; and make palaces for you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And when they are cast within a narrow space of it chained together, they would plead for death.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day He will gather them together along with those they worshipped other than God, He will ask them: "Did you lure these creatures of Mine away, or did they themselves go astray?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will answer: "Glory to You. It was not worthy of us to seek any protector other than You. But You allowed them and their fathers a life of ease until they turned oblivious of the Reminder. They were a people impenitent.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The idolaters will be told): "Your gods have refuted your assertion. You can neither avert (your doom) nor receive any help. We shall make the wicked among you taste of severe punishment."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The idolaters will be told): "Your gods have refuted your assertion. You can neither avert (your doom) nor receive any help. We shall make the wicked among you taste of severe punishment."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We never sent before you apostles who did not eat food and walk the market places. We make some of you the means of trying the others. So will you persevere? Your Lord is always watching.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus do We keep opponents among the sinners for every apostle; yet your Lord is sufficient as a guide and helper.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We gave Moses the Book, and made his brother Aaron his minister,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then We told them: "Go to the people who have rejected Our signs." Then We annihilated them completely.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We administered warnings to each of them, and then destroyed them completely.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you not seen how your Lord lengthens out the shadow? He could have kept it motionless if He liked. Yet We make the sun its pilot to show the way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made the night a covering for you; and made sleep for rest, the day for rising.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made the night a covering for you; and made sleep for rest, the day for rising.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made two bodies of water flow side by side, one fresh (and) sweet, the other brine (and) bitter, and has placed an interstice, a barrier between them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made the night and day an alternation for him who cares to reflect and be grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And those who say: "O Lord, give us comfort in our spouses and children, and make us paragons of those who follow the straight path."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I ran away from you out of fear. But my Lord has given me wisdom, and made me an apostle.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then Moses threw down his staff, and lo, it swallowed up their conjurations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We made them leave the gardens and springs of water,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus it was; and We made the children of Israel possess them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the two forces drew within seeing distance of each other, the people of Moses said: "We shall certainly be overtaken."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who will make me die, then give me life again,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And Hell made visible to those who had gone astray.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Together with the hordes of Iblis.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And whenever you apply force become tyrannical.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leaving the consorts your Lord has made for you? But you are a people who exceed the bounds. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But in case you are speaking the truth, then make a segment of the sky to fall upon us. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just think: If We let them enjoy (the good things of life) for a few years more,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who watches you when you get up,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We make their deeds attractive to those who do not believe in the Hereafter, so that they may wander in perplexity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Except those who do some wrong but afterwards do good to make up for the wrong. And I am forgiving and merciful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I found that she and her people worship the sun in place of God, for Satan has made their deeds look attractive to them and has turned them away from the Path, so they do not find the way

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Take this letter from me, and deliver it to them and withdraw, then see what reply they give in return. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The Queen said): "O nobles, a venerable letter has been delivered to me.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But one who had knowledge of the letter, said: "I will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye." When Solomon saw it before him, (he said): "This is by the grace of my Lord that He may test me whether I am grateful or I am thankless. Yet if one is grateful, he is grateful for himself, and if one is thankless, then surely my Lord is unconcerned and magnanimous."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who created the heavens and the earth, who sends down water from the sky for you, with which He causes graceful gardens to grow? It was not in your power to make trees germinate. Is there any other god along with God. In fact they are a people who turn away (from the truth).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who then made the earth a habitable place, and made the rivers (flow) in its valleys and dales, and placed upon it firm stabilisers, and kept a barrier between two bodies of water? Is there any other god along with God? In reality most of them do not know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who hears the cry of the anguished (soul) when it calls to Him, and relieves its suffering? And who made you trustees on the earth? Is there any other god along with God? How little it is that you reflect!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You cannot make the dead to listen, or the deaf to hear the call, when they have turned their backs,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nor can you lead the blind when they have gone astray. You can make none hear except those who believe in Our signs and have come to peace and submission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do they not see that We made the night for them to rest, the day to make things clear? Indeed there are signs in this for people who believe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do they not see that We made the night for them to rest, the day to make things clear? Indeed there are signs in this for people who believe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We wished to favour those who were weak in the land and make them leaders and heirs,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And establish them in the country; and to make the Pharaoh, Haman and their hordes beware of what they feared from them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We conveyed to the mother of Moses: "Suckle him. If you are afraid for him, cast him in the river without any fear or regret, for We shall restore him to you, and make him an apostle."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made (Moses) refuse a wet nurse. So his sister said: "Should I tell you of a household that could bring him up for you and take care of him?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He came to the city when the people were in a care - free mood, and saw two men quarrelling, one belonging to his community, the other to his enemies. The man who belonged to his community appealed for help against the one who belonged to the enemies. Moses struck him a blow with his fist and finished him off. "This is of Satan 's doing," he said. "He is certainly an enemy and a corrupter."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the morning he came to the city, fearful and hesitant. Just then he who had asked him for help the day before called out for help (again). "You are indeed a meddlesome fellow," Moses said to him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the morning he came to the city, fearful and hesitant. Just then he who had asked him for help the day before called out for help (again). "You are indeed a meddlesome fellow," Moses said to him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then as he was about to lay hands on the one who was their common enemy, he cried out: "O Moses, do you want to kill me as you killed that person yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and no peacemaker."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So send my brother Aaron with me as helper for he is more fluent than I with words, that he should affirm me, for I fear that they would call me a liar. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made them the leaders of those who call to Hell; and on the Day of Judgement they will not be helped.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made them the leaders of those who call to Hell; and on the Day of Judgement they will not be helped.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They say: "If we followed your guidance we would be driven from the land by force." Have We not set up a sanctuary for them, to which is brought a wealth of everything as provision from Us? But most of them do not understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whatsoever has been given you is the stuff this life is made of, and only its embellishment. What is with your Lord is better and abiding. Will you not understand?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "Just think. If God were to make the day perpetual till the Day of Resurrection, what other god but God would bring you night for rest? Why do you not reflect?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yet in His benevolence He made you night and day that you may rest and seek His bounty during them, and haply maybe grateful. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So seek the abode of the Hereafter through what God has given you, and do not forget your part in this world. Do good to others as God has done good to you, and do not try to spread corruption in the land. Surely God does not like corrupters. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We opened up the earth and sunk him and his mansion. There was not a body that could help him against (the will) of God, nor was he able to save himself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who were envious of his position only yesterday said on the morrow: "Indeed God increases the fortunes of those of His creatures as He will, and decreases. Had God not been gracious to us He could have (opened up) the earth and made it swallow us. Surely the infidels will not succeed."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who were envious of his position only yesterday said on the morrow: "Indeed God increases the fortunes of those of His creatures as He will, and decreases. Had God not been gracious to us He could have (opened up) the earth and made it swallow us. Surely the infidels will not succeed."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You did not expect that the Book would be given to you except by the favour of your Lord. So do not be the helper of unbelievers,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nor should you let them turn you away from the commandments of God once they have been delivered to you; and call them to your Lord, and do not be an idolater,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do men think they will get away by saying: "We believe," and will not be tried?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do those who do evil think that they will get the better of Us? How bad is the judgement that they make!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do those who do evil think that they will get the better of Us? How bad is the judgement that they make!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents; but if they try to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them. You have to come back to Us, when I will tell you what you used to do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are among men those who say: "We believe in God;" yet if they happen to suffer in the cause of God they take oppression by men as punishment from God. And if help comes to them from your Lord, they say: "We were with you." Does not God know what is hidden in the hearts of men?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But We saved him and those with him in the ark, and made it a sign for the creatures of the world.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Escape Him you cannot either in the earth or in the sky; and you have no friend or helper apart from God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He said: "You have taken to idols through mutual affection in this life, in place of God, but on the Day of Resurrection you will disown and curse each other, and your abode will be Hell, and you will have none to help you."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You commit unnatural acts with men and cut off the way (of procreation), and commit obscenities in your gatherings. "The only answer his people made was:" Bring the punishment of God, if you are truthful. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"O Lord, help me against the wicked people," (Lot) prayed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And (remember) 'Ad and Thamud. It will be clear to you from their habitations (how they were destroyed), for Satan had made their deeds look attractive to them, and turned them away from the path; and yet they were a people of acumen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the help of God. He helps whom He will; He is all - mighty, ever - merciful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the help of God. He helps whom He will; He is all - mighty, ever - merciful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore evil was the end of those who did evil, for they denied the signs of God and made fun of them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another of His signs is that He created mates of your own kind of yourselves so that you may get peace of mind from them, and has put love and compassion between you. Verily there are signs in this for those who reflect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And yet the wicked follow their own lusts without understanding. Who can show the way to those whom God allows to go astray? None will they have to help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is God who created you, then gave you sustenance, then He will make you die, and bring you back to life. Is there one among those you associate with Him who can do the least of these things? Too high and exalted is He for what they associate with Him!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Among His signs are the breezes He sends as harbingers of happy news, so that He may allow you to taste of His mercy, and that ships may sail by His command, and you may seek of His bounty, and may haply be grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verily We sent many apostles before you to their people, who brought clear signs with them. Then We retributed those who were sinful. It is a duty incumbent on Us to help the believers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You cannot make the dead to listen nor the deaf hear the call when they have turned back and retreated,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nor can you make the blind see the way when they have gone astray. You can make none hear except those who believe Our signs and have come to submission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nor can you make the blind see the way when they have gone astray. You can make none hear except those who believe Our signs and have come to submission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is God who created you of weakness, then after weakness gave you strength, then after strength will give you weakness and grey hair. Surely He makes whatever He wills. He is all - knowing and all - powerful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Their excuses will be of no avail to the sinners on that day, and they will not be allowed to beg for favour.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So have patience. The promise of God is surely true; and let not those who do not believe make you relax (your endeavours).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So have patience. The promise of God is surely true; and let not those who do not believe make you relax (your endeavours).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If they try to force you to associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. Live with them honourably in the world, but follow the way of him who turns to Me. Your returning is to Me in the end, when I will tell you what you did.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So do not let the unbelief of disbelievers grieve you. They will be brought back to Us, when We shall tell them what they used to do. Whatever is in their hearts is known to God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We let them enjoy themselves only for a while, then We shall drag them to a severe punishment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you not see that God makes the night succeed the day, the day succeed the night? And He has harnessed the sun and the moon so that each runs its appointed course. Surely God is aware of all you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O people, fear your Lord and dread the day when no father will avail a son, nor son his father. Truly the promise of God is true. Do not be deluded by the life of this world, and do not let the deceiver draw you away from God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who made all things He created excellent; and first fashioned man from clay,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then made his offspring from the extract of base fluid,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had We intended We could have given every soul its guidance; but inevitable is My word that I will fill up Hell with men and jinns together.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So now suffer. As you forgot the meeting of this your Day of Doom, so have We forgotten you. Now taste the everlasting punishment for your deeds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So now suffer. As you forgot the meeting of this your Day of Doom, so have We forgotten you. Now taste the everlasting punishment for your deeds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But We shall make them taste the affliction of this world before the greater torment, so that they may retract.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verily We gave Moses the Book; so be not in doubt about his having received it; and We made it a guidance for the children of Israel.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has not provided two hearts in the breast of a man, nor made your wives, whom you pronounce "mothers" (in order to divorce them), your real mothers, nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. This is only what your lips pronounce. God says what is just, and shows the right way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Call them by the names of their fathers. This is the right course in the sight of God. If you do not know their fathers, they are then your brothers in religion and your friends. It will not be a sin if you make a mistake, unless you do so intentionally; for God is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When We made the covenant with the prophets, and with you, as with Noah and Abraham, Moses and Jesus son of Mary, a binding covenant,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, remember the favours of God to you when an army came against you and We sent a wind against them and forces that you did not see. But God sees all that you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they came upon you from above and below you, when the eyes were stupefied with horror, and hearts jumped to the throats, and you made wild suppositions about God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The faithful were sorely tried there and were shaken completely,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whereas earlier they had made a promise to God that they would never turn their backs; and a promise made to God is answerable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whereas earlier they had made a promise to God that they would never turn their backs; and a promise made to God is answerable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "Who will save you from God if He decide to afflict you or show you His mercy?" They will never find a friend or helper apart from God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Being chary of helping you. But when danger appears you will find them looking at you with eyes turning like a man 's in the swoon of death. Yet when the danger is past they lash you with sharp tongues, covetous of the best (of booty). Such as these have not come to belief. So God nullifies whatever they have done. This is how (the innate law of) God works inevitably.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are men among the faithful who have been true to the covenant they had made with God; and some of them fulfilled their vows (by dying in His cause), and some still wait (prepared for death), and stand firm,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God drove the unbelievers back in their fury, and they gained no advantage. God was sufficient (to help) the believers in the battle. God is all - powerful and all - mighty.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He made those of the people of the Book who had helped (the tribes) descend from their forts, and filled their hearts with dread, so that you killed some and made many captive;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He made those of the people of the Book who had helped (the tribes) descend from their forts, and filled their hearts with dread, so that you killed some and made many captive;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And He made you inherit their lands and mansions and wealth, and a country you had not traversed before, for God has power over everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O Prophet, say to your wives: "In case you desire the life and pomp of this world, come, I will provide you handsomely, and let you go with a grace.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, when you marry believing women then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the 'waiting period' of them. But provide suitably for them, and let them go with honour.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have made lawful for you, O Prophet, wives to whom you have given their dower, and God - given maids and captives you have married, and the daughters of your father 's brothers and daughters of your father' s sisters, and daughters of your mother 's brothers and sisters, who migrated with you; and a believing woman who offers herself to the Prophet if the Prophet desires to marry her. This is a privilege only for you and not the other believers. We know what We have ordained for them about their wives and maids they possess, so that you may be free of blame, for God is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will live in it for ever, and will find no saviour or helper.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We favoured David with excellence, (and commanded): "O Jibal and Tair, glorify the greatness of God with him." And We made iron pliable for him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We (subjugated) the wind to Solomon. Its morning 's journey took one month, and the evening' s one month. We made a spring of molten brass to flow for him; and many jinns laboured for him by the will of his Lord. Anyone of them who turned from Our command was made to taste the torment of blazing fire.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They made for him whatever he wished, synagogues and statues, dishes large as water - troughs, and cauldrons firmly fixed (on ovens; and We said): "O House of David, act, and give thanks." But few among My creatures are thankful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But they turned away. So We let loose on them the inundation of (the dyke of) al - 'Arim, replacing their gardens with two other gardens which bore only bitter gourd, and tamarisks and a few sparse lote - trees.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Between them and the cities We had blessed We placed towns along the highway, and made them stages on their journey, (saying): "Travel between them in safety by day or by night."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But they said: "O Lord, make the distance between the stages of our journeys longer;" but (by doing so) they wronged themselves. So We turned them into bygone tales, and dispersed them, scattered in all directions. Surely there are signs in this for those who endeavour and are grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "Call on those you imagine are gods apart from God. They are not masters even of an atom 's weight in the heavens and the earth, nor do they have a share in them, nor is any one of them a helper (of God).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
No intercession avails with Him except his He allows, so that when their hearts are freed of fear, they ask (one another): "What did your Lord say?" They will answer: "What is expedient. He is the all - mighty and supreme."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "Our Lord will gather us together and judge between us equitably, for He is the Judge all - knowing."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The unbelievers say: "We do not believe in this Qur 'an, nor in what was (sent) before it." If only you could see the sinners when they are made to stand before their Lord, blaming one another! Those who were weak will say to those who were arrogant: "But for you we would have certainly been believers."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day He will gather all of them together, He will ask the angels: "Did they worship you?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you people, the promise of God is true. So do not let the life of this world delude you, nor let that (arch) deceiver deceive you about God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you people, the promise of God is true. So do not let the life of this world delude you, nor let that (arch) deceiver deceive you about God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can he, the evil of whose deed is made to look attractive to him so that he considers it good, (be like him who is guided)? God leads whosoever He please astray and guides whosoever He will. So do not waste away your self with grief for them. God is indeed cognisant of things they do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alike are not two bodies of water: This one is sweet and fresh and pleasant to drink, and this one brine and bitter; yet you get fresh meat to eat from both, and take out ornaments to wear. You see how the ships churn through them so that you may seek of His bounty and, perhaps, give thanks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He makes night run into day, the day run into night, and has harnessed the sun and the moon so that each runs to its determined course. This is God your Lord; His is the kingdom; and those you invoke apart from Him are not masters even of the film on a date - palm stone.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
No one who carries a burden bears another 's load; and even if the burdened soul cry out for help none will carry the least of its burden, however close a relative it may be. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in secret and fulfil their devotional obligations. Whoever grows in goodness does so for himself. To God is the journeying back.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equal are not the living and the dead. Verily God makes those He will to listen; but you cannot make those hear who are in their graves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equal are not the living and the dead. Verily God makes those He will to listen; but you cannot make those hear who are in their graves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We made those of Our creatures whom We had chosen, heirs to the Book; but some of these exceed themselves, and some follow the middle course, and some surpass others in goodness by God 's will, which is the greatest blessing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will enter the gardens of Eden, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and of silk will be their garments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There they will cry for help: "O Lord, get us out that we may do the right, and not what we used to do." Did We not give you a long enough span of life so that he who remembered may reflect? And did not the warner come to you? So now taste (the punishment). The iniquitous will have none to help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He is the one who made you trustees on the earth. So he who disbelieves, will bear the consequence of his unbelief. but their unbelief will only increase disgust for unbelievers in the sight of their Lord; and their unbelief will only lead the unbelievers to greater loss.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How my Lord has forgiven me and made me one of those who are honoured! "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alas for men! No apostle ever came to them but they made fun of him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will all be brought together before Us.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have laid out gardens of dates and grapes upon it, and made springs of water flow,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We made similar vessels for them to ride.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We could have drowned them if We pleased, and none would have answered their cry for help, nor would they have been saved,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then they would not be able to make a will, or go back to their people.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whom We made subservient to them so that some of them they ride and some they eat?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And take other gods apart from God that they may perhaps give them help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will not be able to help them and will be brought (to Us) as their levied troops.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And applies comparisons to Us, having forgotten his origin, and says: "Who can put life into decayed bones?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You say: "Yes; and you will be lowly made."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gather all the wicked together and their comrades, and those they had worshipped

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"What is the matter with you that you do not help each other?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And made his progeny survive,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"When God has created you and what you make?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So they contrived a plot against him, but We made them abject.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And left (his hallowed memory) for posterity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And helped them, so they were victorious.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then he was swallowed by a large fish as he was worthy of blame.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We made a gourd tree grow over him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And they came to believe; so We allowed them to enjoy the good things of life for an age.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or did We make the angels females, and they witnessed it?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"God has begotten (children)?" They are liars indeed!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That they would be helped,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, theirs? Then let them climb up the ladders (to the heavens).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This man here is my brother. He has ninety and nine ewes while I have only one. He demands that I should give him my ewe, and wants to get the better of me in argument. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"O David, We have made you trustee on the earth. So judge between men equitably, and do not follow your lust lest it should lead you astray from the way of God. Surely for those who go astray from the way of God, is severe punishment, for having forgotten the Day of Reckoning.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"O David, We have made you trustee on the earth. So judge between men equitably, and do not follow your lust lest it should lead you astray from the way of God. Surely for those who go astray from the way of God, is severe punishment, for having forgotten the Day of Reckoning.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should We equate those who do the right with those who spread corruption in the land? Should We make those who are morally integrated equal to those who seek disintegration?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Take a handful of herbs," (We said to him), and apply and rub them, and do not make a mistake. "We found him patient in adversity, an excellent devotee, always turning in repentance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And when I have made him and have breathed into him of My spirit. Fall down in homage before him. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will fill up Hell with you together with those who follow you. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When man is afflicted with adversity he turns to his Lord, and prays to Him. But when He bestows His favour on him, he forgets what he prayed for before, and sets up others as compeers of God to mislead (people) from His way. Say: "Take advantage of your denying for a while: You will be among the inmates of Hell."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tell them: "O my creatures who have come to belief, have fear of displeasing your Lord. There is good for those who do good in this world, and productive is God 's earth. Only those who persevere will get their reward measureless."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you not see that God sends down water from the sky, then makes it flow in rills on the earth, and brings forth corn from it which, having passed through changes of shade and colour, comes to ripen, and you see it autumnal yellow; then He reduces it to chaff. There are indeed lessons in this for those who are wise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has sent down the very best discourse, the Book conformable in its juxtapositions, which makes all of those who fear their Lord, shudder. So their hearts and bodies become receptive to the remembrance of God. This is the guidance of God with which He guides whosoever He will; but whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then God made them taste of disgrace in this life; and the torment of the life to come is greater, if they understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is not God sufficient for His devotee? Still they frighten you with others apart from Him. Whoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then the worst of what they had done overtook them. So will the evil deeds of those who are sinners among them recoil back on them. They cannot get the better (of Us).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Turn towards your Lord and obey Him before the punishment comes upon you when you will not be helped.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will say: "All praise be to God Who has fulfilled the promise He had made to us, and bequeathed to us this land for dwelling in the garden wheresoever we like." How excellent the recompense for those who act!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only the unbelievers dispute the revelations of God. So do not let their activities in the land deceive you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They say: "O Lord, twice You made us die, and twice You made us live. We admit our sins. Is there still a way out for us?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They say: "O Lord, twice You made us die, and twice You made us live. We admit our sins. Is there still a way out for us?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Let me kill Moses," the Pharaoh said, "and let him call to his Lord. I fear that he will change your faith and spread corruption in the land."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day you will turn your backs and flee, with none to defend you against God. Whoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of reaching the tracts of heaven and look at the god of Moses, though I think that he is a liar. "Thus were the evil deeds of Pharaoh made to look attractive to him, and he was hindered from the path. So the stratagem of Pharaoh was bound to perish.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will certainly help Our messengers and those who believe, in this world, and on the day the witnesses take their stand,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is God who made the night for you to rest, the day to make things visible. Indeed God is gracious to men, but most men are not grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is God who made the night for you to rest, the day to make things visible. Indeed God is gracious to men, but most men are not grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is God who made the earth a dwelling for you, and the sky a vaulted roof, who fashioned you and gave you excellent form and provided you with clean and wholesome things. He is God, your Lord. So blessed be God, the Lord of all the worlds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is God who made the cattle for you so that some you ride and some you eat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then He turned to the heavens, and it was smoke. So He said to it and the earth: "Come with willing obedience or perforce." They said: "We come willingly."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We let loose on them a violent wind for several days of distress to make them taste a most disgraceful punishment here in this world, and far more shameful will be the punishment in the Hereafter, and there will be no succour for them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We let loose on them a violent wind for several days of distress to make them taste a most disgraceful punishment here in this world, and far more shameful will be the punishment in the Hereafter, and there will be no succour for them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And they will say to their bodies: "Why did you testify against us?" They will answer: "God, who gave all things power of articulation, made us speak. It is He who created you the first time, and to Him you will return.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We had assigned to them close companions who made their past and present look attractive to them; and the fate that had once befallen the communities of jinns and men before them was justified upon them. They were indeed bound to perish.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We shall make the disbelievers taste the severest punishment, and retribute them for the worst that they had done.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who disbelieve will say: "O Lord, show us those among the jinns and men who had led us astray that we may trample them underfoot and make them wholly abject."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are your friends in this life and in the Hereafter where you will get whatever your hearts desire, and have whatsoever you ask for,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If We had made it a discourse in an obscure tongue, they would have said: "Why were its revelations not expounded distinctly? A foreign tongue and an Arab (audience)?" Say: "For those who believe it is a guidance and a healing; but for those who do not believe it is a deafness in the ears, and a blindness. They are those one calls to from far away.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If God had pleased He would have made them one community of belief; but He admits whom He please to His grace; yet the sinners have neither friend nor helper.

Originator of the heavens and the earth, He has made your consorts from among you, and made pairs of cattle. He multiplies you in this way. There is no other like Him. He is all - hearing and all - seeing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yet to that (law) you should call them, and be constant as commanded. Do not follow their passing whims, but say: "I believe in whatever Scripture God has revealed, and I am commanded to act with equivalence among you. God is our Lord and your Lord. To us our actions, to you your deeds. There is no dispute between you and us. God will gather us all together, and to Him is our returning."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As for those who argue in the matter of God after He has been fully acknowledged, their disputing has no force with their Lord. Upon them is (God 's) anger, and the punishment for them will be severe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The creation of the heavens and the earth and all the living things dispersed in them, are a sign of His. He has the power to gather them together when He will.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You cannot thwart Him on the earth, and have no friend or helper apart from Him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will have no protector to help them other than God. He whom God allows to go astray has no way.

They will have no protector to help them other than God. He whom God allows to go astray has no way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If they turn away (you are not responsible); We have not appointed you a warden over them. Your duty is to deliver the message. When We let man taste of Our favours he begins to exult; but if misfortune befalls him, as a consequence of his own deeds, man is surely then ungrateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So have We revealed to you the Qur 'an by Our command. You did not know what the Scripture was before, nor (the laws of) faith. And We made it a light by which We show the way to those of Our creatures as We please; and you certainly guide them to the right path,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That We made it a distinctly lucid Qur 'an that you may understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He who made the earth a bed for you, and laid out tracks upon it so that you may find the way;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yet they make some of His creatures His offspring! Man is surely most ungrateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yet they have made the angels, who are creatures of Ar - Rahman, females. Did they witness their creation? We shall record their testimony, and they will be interrogated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yet they say: "If Ar - Rahman had so pleased we would not have worshipped them." They have no knowledge of it in the least. They only make up lies.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In fact, I allowed them and their fathers to enjoy this life till the truth, and the apostle preaching it lucidly, came to them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are they the ones who dispense the favour of your Lord? It is He who apportions the means of livelihood among them in this world, and raises some in position over the others to make some others submissive. The favours of your Lord are better than what they amass.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you make the deaf to hear, or show the blind, and those lost in clear error, the way?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But they said: "O sorcerer, call on your Lord for us in accordance with the compact He has made with you. We shall certainly come to guidance."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why were then no bracelets of gold shed upon him from above, or angels sent down as a retinue with him? "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus he made light (of the matter) to his people, and they obeyed him. They were certainly wicked.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And made them a precedent and example for posterity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Jesus) was only a creature whom We favoured and made an example for the children of Israel.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Golden platters and goblets will be passed around, and everything the heart desires and pleases the eye will be there, where you will abide for ever.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will call (to the keeper of Hell - gate): "O Malik, let your Lord decide our fate." He will answer: "You are to stay."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day when friend will help no friend in the least, nor will they be helped,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day when friend will help no friend in the least, nor will they be helped,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore We have made this (Qur 'an) easy in your tongue. They may haply take a warning.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When he comes to know something of Our messages he makes fun of them: For them is shameful punishment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do those who seek evil think that We shall make them equal in life and death to those who believe and do good? How bad is the judgement that they make!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do those who seek evil think that We shall make them equal in life and death to those who believe and do good? How bad is the judgement that they make!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just think: Who apart from God can show the way to him who deifies his ego into his god, whom God allows to go astray knowingly, and seals his ears and heart, and covers over his eyes with a veil? Why then do you not contemplate?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "God, who gives you life and makes you die, will (raise the dead) then gather you (and your ancestors) together on the Day of Resurrection of which there is no doubt." And yet most men do not understand.

"We shall ignore you today," they will be told, "as you had forgotten the meeting of this Day. Your dwelling place is Hell, and there is none to save you:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When all men are gathered together (on that Day) they will become their enemies and deny their worship.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They are those from whom We accept the very best of what they have done, and overlook their faults. They will be among the inmates of Paradise: A true promise they have been made.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But he who says to his parents: "Shame on you: You intimidate me that I will be resurrected when many generations will have passed before me?" And (the parents) would implore God 's help: "Woe to you. You better believe. The promise of God is certainly true." Yet he answers: "These are only fables of long ago."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, when you clash with the unbelievers, smite their necks until you overpower them, then hold them in bondage. Then either free them graciously or after taking a ransom, until war shall have come to end. If God had pleased He could have punished them (Himself), but He wills to test some of you through some others. He will not allow the deeds of those who are killed in the cause of God to go waste.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, if you help (in the cause of) God He will surely come to your aid, and firmly plant your feet.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many were the habitations, mightier than your city which has turned you out, which We destroyed; and they did not have a helper.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That God may save you from earlier and subsequent blames, and complete His favours on you, and guide you on the straight path,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And help you with surpassing help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And help you with surpassing help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who swear allegiance to you indeed swear allegiance to God; and God 's protection is over them. Then whosoever breaks the promise breaks it to his own loss; but whosoever fulfills the promise made to God will receive a great reward from Him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who had stayed behind will say: "When you depart for taking the spoils, allow us to follow you." They wish to change the word of God. Tell them: "You will not follow us. That is what God has already said before." They will say: "You are envious of our gain." The fact is they understand but little.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had the unbelievers fought you they would have turned their backs and not found a protector or helper.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has truly made the vision of His Apostle come true: You will surely enter the Holy Mosque in security if God please, without any fear, having shaved your heads and cut your hair. He knew what you did not know, and has vouchsafed you, apart from this, a victory near at hand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad is the Prophet of God; and those who are with him are severe with infidels but compassionate among themselves. You may see them kneeling and bowing in reverence, seeking His favour and acceptance. Their mark is on their foreheads from the effect of prostrations. Their likeness in the Torah, and their likeness in the Gospel, is like a seed that sends out a stalk, then makes it firm, and it becomes strong and rises straight upon its stem, gladdening the cultivator 's heart, in order to fill the unbelievers with dismay. God has promised those who believe and do the right forgiveness and a great reward.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Know that the Apostle of God is among you: If he agreed with you in most matters you would surely come to grief. But God has made faith more desirable to you, and attractive to your hearts, and rendered disbelief and sin and disobedience repugnant. They are those who are well directed

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If two groups of believers come to fight one another, promote peace between them. Then if one of them turns aggressive against the other, fight against the aggressive party till it returns to God 's authority. If it does so, make peace among them equitably and be impartial. Verily God loves those who are just.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We stretched the earth and placed upon it firm stabilisers and We made every kind of splendid thing to grow upon it

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is not a word he utters but an observer is ready (to make note of it).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day the earth will split asunder they will come out hurriedly. This gathering together is easy for Us.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verily the promise made to you is true:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So as to let loose clods of clay on them

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who do wrong will indeed come to the same end as their fellows (of old). So let them not ask Me to hasten (the punishment).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let them bring a discourse like it, if they are truthful

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Their deception will not avail them in the least on that day, nor will they be helped.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can ever man get what he desires?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That it is He who makes you happy and morose,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That it is He who makes you rich and contented;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So he prayed to his Lord: "I am helpless, deliver me."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But We bore him on a (vessel made) of planks and oakum,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy have We made the Qur 'an to understand: So is there any one who will be warned?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We let loose against them a violent roaring wind on a day of ill omen, continuous,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy have We made the Qur 'an to understand: So is there any one who will pay heed?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy have We made the Qur 'an to understand: So is there any one who will be warned?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy have We made the Qur 'an to understand: So is there any one who will be warned?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He has set two seas in motion that flow side by side together,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And made them virginal,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will be gathered together on a certain day which is predetermined.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We could make it brackish, if We pleased; so why do you not acknowledge thanks?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider the fire that you strike (and get by friction).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have made it as a reminder and convenience for the needy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What has come upon you that you do not spend in the way of God, when the heritage of the heavens and the earth belongs to God? Those of you who spent before the victory and fought, are not equal (to those who did not). They are higher in position than those who spent after (the victory) and fought. To each one God has made the promise of excellence, for God is aware of all you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will call to them: "Were we not with you?" They will answer: "Certainly; but then you let yourselves be tempted, and waited in expectation but were suspicious and were deceived by vain desires, till the decree of God came to pass, and the deceiver duped you in respect of God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Know that the life of this world is only a frolic and mummery, an ornamentation, boasting and bragging among yourselves, and lust for multiplying wealth and children. It is like rain so pleasing to the cultivator for his vegetation which sprouts and swells, and then begins to wither, and you see it turn to yellow and reduced to chaff. There is severe punishment in the Hereafter, but also forgiveness from God, and acceptance. As for the life of this world, it is no more than merchandise of vanity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no calamity that befalls the earth or your own selves but in accordance with the law (of causation) before We make it evident. This is indeed how the law of God works inevitably.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have surely sent apostles with clear signs, and sent with them the Book and the Balance, so that men may stand by justice; and We sent down iron which causes much distress but also has advantages for men, so that God may know who helps Him and His apostles in secret. Verily God is all - powerful and all - mighty.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those of you who divorce your wives by calling them 'mothers,' cannot (make them) their mothers. Their mothers are only those who gave birth to them. They surely utter what is unseemly and a lie. But God is forbearing and forgiving.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the day when God will raise them up together, He will tell them what they did. God takes account of it although they forget, for all things are evident to God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the day when God will raise them up together, He will tell them what they did. God takes account of it although they forget, for all things are evident to God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, when you are told to make room in the assemblies, then make room; God will give you more room to spread. When you are told to rise, then rise; God will raise those of you who believe, and those who have knowledge, in position. God is aware of what you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They have made their oaths a shield, and obstruct people from the way of God. There is shameful punishment for them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the day that God will raise them together, they will swear before Him as they swear before you, and imagine they are on the right path. Is it not they who are liars?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satan has got the better of them. and made them forget to remember God. Indeed they belong to Satan 's faction. Will not Satan' s faction perish?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The spoils are also for the poor emigrants who were deprived of their homes and possessions and are seeking the bounty and protection of God, and are helping God and His Apostle. They are the ones who are true of word and deed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If they are driven out, they will not go with them; and if they are attacked, they will not aid them. And even if they aided them, they will turn their backs, then they will not be helped.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And be not like those who have forgotten God, so that God has made them forget themselves. Such are the reprobates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And be not like those who have forgotten God, so that God has made them forget themselves. Such are the reprobates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O Lord, make us not an example of punishment for infidels, and forgive us, O Lord. You are all - mighty and all - wise. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He only forbids you from making friends with those who fought over faith with you and banished you from your homes, and aided in your exile. Whoever makes friends with them is a transgressor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If any of your women go away to the unbelievers, and you succeed in your turn (and have a chance of getting spoils), then give to those whose wives have so gone away as much as they had spent on them; but take heed and fear God in whom you believe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, do not make friends with those who have suffered the anger of God by having become despondent of the life to come like those unbelievers who are despondent of those who are in the graves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When Moses said to his people: "O my people, why do you afflict me though you know that I have been sent to you by God?" But when they turned aside God made their hearts turn farther away; for God does not show the transgressors the way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And (He will give you) what is dearest to you - - help from God and early victory. So give good tidings to those who believe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, be helpers of God, as Jesus, son of Mary, had said to the disciples: "Who will help me in the way of God?" and they had answered: "We are the helpers of God." Then a section among the children of Israel believed, but a section among them did not. So We helped those who believed against their enemies, and they prevailed over them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, when the call to prayer is made on the day of congregation, hasten to remember God, putting aside your business. This is better for you if you can understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They have made their oaths a shield in order to obstruct others from the way of God. It is certainly evil what they do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you tell them: "Come, let the Apostle of God ask forgiveness for you," they turn their heads, and you see them turning away with arrogance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, let not your wealth and children make you negligent of the remembrance of God. Those who do so will be losers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, let not your wealth and children make you negligent of the remembrance of God. Those who do so will be losers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day He will gather you together on the Day of Gathering, will be the day of Judgement. He who believed and did the right, will have his evil deeds expunged by God and admitted to gardens with rivers flowing by, and abide there perpetually. This will be the great achievement of success.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they have reached their appointed time, then either keep them lawfully or let them go honourably; but have two witnesses from among you, and give truthful evidence for (being acceptable to) God. This is to warn him who believes in God and the Last Day. God will furnish a way out for him who fears Him,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As for your women who have lost hope of menstruation, and in case you have a doubt, the prescribed period (of waiting) for them is three months, as also for those who have not menstruated yet. As for those who are pregnant, their prescribed period is until the delivery of the child. God will make things easy for him who is mindful of God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
House the (divorced) women where you live, according to your means; but do not harass them so as to reduce them to straitened circumstances. If they are pregnant, then spend on them until they give birth to the child. And if they suckle the child for you, then make the due payment to them, and consult each other appropriately. But if you find this difficult, let some other woman suckle (the child) for her.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
An Apostle who recites before you the explicating revelations of God that He may bring those who believe and do the right out of darkness into light. Whosoever believes in God and does the right, He will admit into gardens with rivers flowing by, where they will abide for ever. How excellent a provision has God made for him

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O PROPHET, WHY should you forbid (yourself) what God has made lawful for you, in order to please your wives? Yet God is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the Prophet told one of his wives something in confidence and she disclosed it, God revealed this to him. So he made some of it known to her, and held back some. When, however, he informed her about it, she asked: "Who told you this?" He said: "I was told this by the All - knowing, All - Informed."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If both of you two (women) turn to God in penitence (it would be better). Your hearts have been impaired; and if you assist one another against him, then surely his helper is God, and Gabriel and the righteous believers, and, besides them, the angels are his helpers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(And say:) "O you who do not believe, make no excuses today. You will be requited only for what you had done."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have adorned the lowest sky with lamps, and made them missiles against the devils, for whom We have prepared a torment of most intense fire.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made the earth subservient to you that you may travel all around it, and eat of things He has provided; and to Him will be your resurrection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are you so unafraid that He who is in Heaven will not open up the earth to swallow you, when it will begin to tremble?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What other army do you have to help you apart from Ar - Rahman? The unbelievers are surely lost in delusion.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"If you want to gather the fruits, let us go early to the plantation."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or have you taken a binding promise from Us which would hold till the Day of Judgement, that you will get whatever you demand?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to make it a warning for you, and that the ear retentive may preserve it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But whosoever gets his ledger in his left hand, will say: "Would that I were never given my ledger,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God produced you from the earth like a vegetable growth;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has made the earth for you a spreading,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They were drowned because of their habitual sinfulness, and sent to Hell, and did not find any helper other than God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you leave them, they will lead Your creatures astray, and beget but iniquitous and ungrateful offspring.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So when we heard the guidance we believed in it; and he who believes in his Lord will neither fear loss nor force.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other than an apostle He has chosen, when He makes a sentinel walk in front of him and a sentinel behind,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verily this is a reminder. So let him who desires take the way to his Lord.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And made things easy for them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have not appointed any one but angels as keepers of Hell, and their number that We have fixed is to make it a means of contention for disbelievers, so that those who were given the Book may be certain, and the faith of the believers may have greater increase, and the people of the Book and believers may not be deceived, and the sceptics and infidels may say: "What does God mean by this parable?" That is how God leads whosoever He will astray, and guides whosoever He will. None knows the armies of your Lord save Him self. This is no more than reminder for mankind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does man think We shall not put his bones together?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And it is asked: "Is there any reciter of charms and amulets?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
From a spring of which the votaries of God will drink and make it flow in abundance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Passed round will be silver flagons and goblets made of glass,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Passed round will be silver flagons and goblets made of glass,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On their bodies will be garments of the finest green silk and brocade, and they will be adorned with bracelets of silver; and their Lord will give them a purest draught to drink.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surely men love what hastes away and forget the grievous day (ahead).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So shall We make the later ones to follow them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have We not made the earth a repository

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nor given leave to make excuses.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Did We not make the earth a spreading,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And made sleep for you to rest,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That We may produce from it grain and vegetation,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day the Spirit takes its stand, with the angels ranged in rows. None will speak except who is permitted by Ar - Rahman and says what is right.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And Hell made visible to him who can see,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What made you think that he will not grow in virtue,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then made his passage easy (at birth);

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We made corn grow,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mountains made to move,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And when they went back to their people turned to make fun of them;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full of fire fed by faggots,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Preserved) on the guarded tablet.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let man consider what he was made of:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He will have no strength or helper.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We shall make you recite (the Qur 'an) so that you will not forget it,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We shall make you recite (the Qur 'an) so that you will not forget it,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goblets set,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the apostle of God had to tell them: "This is God 's she - camel, let her drink."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who should then make you deny the Judgement after this?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let him call his associates,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
An Apostle from God, reading out hallowed pages

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Did He not make their plan go wrong,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He has begotten no one, and is begotten of none.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He has begotten no one, and is begotten of none.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You alone we worship, and to You alone turn for help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But God will turn the joke against them and allow them to sink deeper into evil and wander perplexed in their wickedness.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who made the earth a bed for you, the sky a canopy, and sends forth rain from the skies that fruits may grow - - your food and sustenance. So, do not make another the equal of God knowingly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who made the earth a bed for you, the sky a canopy, and sends forth rain from the skies that fruits may grow - - your food and sustenance. So, do not make another the equal of God knowingly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then how can you disbelieve in God? He gave you life when you were dead. He will make you die again then bring you back to life: To Him then you will return.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He made for you all that lies within the earth, then turning to the firmament He proportioned several skies: He has knowledge of everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will you enjoin good deeds on the others and forget your own selves? You also read the Scriptures, why do you then not understand?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember, O children of Israel, the favours I bestowed on you, and made you exalted among the nations of the world.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Take heed of the day when no man will be useful to man in the least, when no intercession matter nor ransom avail, nor help reach them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And made the cloud spread shade over you, and sent for you manna and quails that you may eat of the good things We have made for you. No harm was done to Us, they only harmed themselves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And made the cloud spread shade over you, and sent for you manna and quails that you may eat of the good things We have made for you. No harm was done to Us, they only harmed themselves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember the day We made the covenant with you and exalted you on the Mount and said: "Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is therein that you may take heed."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And whom We made an example for the people (of the day) and those after them, and warning for those who fear God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember, when We made a covenant with the people of Israel and said: "Worship no one but God, and be good to your parents and your kin, and to orphans and the needy, and speak of goodness to men; observe your devotional obligations, and give zakat (the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others)," you went back (on your word), except only a few, and paid no heed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And remember, when We made a covenant with you whereby you agreed you will neither shed blood among you nor turn your people out of their homes, you promised, and are witness to it too.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They are those who bought the life of the world at the cost of the life to come; and neither will their torment decrease nor help reach them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And every time they made a pledge some of them pushed it aside, and many of them do not believe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yet they say that God has begotten a son. May He be praised! Indeed everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him, and all are obedient to God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their way. Say: "God 's guidance alone is true guidance;" for if you give in to their wishes after having received the (Book of) knowledge from God, then none will you have as friend or helper to save you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O children of Israel, remember the favours I bestowed on you, and made you exalted among the nations of the world.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fear the day when no man will stand up for man in the least, and no ransom avail nor intercession matter nor help reach.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember, when his Lord tried Abraham by a number of commands which he fulfilled, God said to him: "I will make you a leader among men." And when Abraham asked: "From my progeny too?" the Lord said: "My pledge does not include transgressors."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember, We made the House (of Ka 'bah) a place of congregation and safe retreat, and said: "Make the spot where Abraham stood the place of worship;" and enjoined upon Abraham and Ishmael to keep Our House immaculate for those who shall walk around it and stay in it for contemplation and prayer, and for bowing in adoration.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And when Abraham said: "O Lord, make this a city of peace, and give those of its citizens who believe in God and the Last Day fruits for food," He answered: "To those will I also give a little who believe not, for a time, then drag them to Hell, a dreadful destination!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And make us submit, O Lord, to Your will, and our progeny a people submissive to You. Teach us the way of worship and forgive our trespasses, for You are compassionate and merciful;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who will turn away from the creed of Abraham but one dull of soul? We made him the chosen one here in the world, and one of the best in the world to come,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "We believe in God and what has been sent down to us, and what had been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their progeny, and that which was given to Moses and Christ, and to all other prophets by the Lord. We make no distinction among them, and we submit to Him."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The foolish will now ask and say: "What has made the faithful turn away from the Qiblah towards which they used to pray?" Say: "To God belong the East and the West. He guides who so wills to the path that is straight."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have made you a temperate people that you act as witness over man, and the Prophet as witness over you. We decreed the Qiblah which you faced before that We may know who follow the Apostle and who turn away in haste. And this was a hard (test) except for those who were guided by God. But God will not suffer your faith to go waste, for God is to men full of mercy and grace.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each has a goal to which he turns. So strive towards piety and excel the others: God will bring you all together wheresoever you be. God has power over everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They who conceal Our signs and the guidance We have sent them and have made clear in the Book, are condemned of God and are condemned by those who are worthy of condemning.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who conceal any part of the Scriptures that God has revealed, and thus make a little profit thereby, take nothing but fire as food; and God will not turn to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor nourish them for growth; and their doom will be painful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fast a (fixed) number of days, but if someone is ill or is travelling (he should complete) the number of days (he had missed); and those who find it hard to fast should expiate by feeding a poor person. For the good they do with a little hardship is better for men. And if you fast it is good for you, if you knew.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ramadan is the month in which the Qur 'an was revealed as guidance to man and clear proof of the guidance, and criterion (of falsehood and truth). So when you see the new moon you should fast the whole month; but a person who is ill or travelling (and fails to do so) should fast on other days, as God wishes ease and not hardship for you, so that you complete the (fixed) number (of fasts), and give glory to God for the guidance, and be grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are allowed to sleep with your wives on the nights of the fast: They are your dress as you are theirs. God is aware you were cheating yourselves, so He turned to you and pardoned you. So now you may have intercourse with them, and seek what God has ordained for you. Eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears clear from the dark line, then fast until the night falls; and abstain from your wives (when you have decided) to stay in the mosques for assiduous devotion. These are the bounds fixed by God, so keep well within them. So does God make His signs clear to men that they may take heed for themselves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perform the pilgrimage and holy visit ('Umra, to Makkah) in the service of God. But if you are prevented, send an offering which you can afford as sacrifice, and do not shave your heads until the offering has reached the place of sacrifice. But if you are sick or have ailment of the scalp (preventing the shaving of hair), then offer expiation by fasting or else giving alms or a sacrificial offering. When you have security, then those of you who wish to perform the holy visit along with the pilgrimage, should make a sacrifice according to their means. But he who has nothing, should fast for three days during the pilgrimage and seven on return, completing ten. This applies to him whose family does not live near the Holy Mosque. Have fear of God, and remember that God is severe in punishment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perform the pilgrimage and holy visit ('Umra, to Makkah) in the service of God. But if you are prevented, send an offering which you can afford as sacrifice, and do not shave your heads until the offering has reached the place of sacrifice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known are the months of pilgrimage. If one resolves to perform the pilgrimage in these months, let him not indulge in concupiscence, sin or quarrel. And the good you do shall be known to God. Provide for the journey, and the best of provisions is piety. O men of understanding, obey Me.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a man who talks well of the world to your pleasing, and makes God witness to what is in his heart, yet he is the most contentious;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you falter even after Our signs have reached you, then do not forget that God is all - powerful and all - wise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you think you will find your way to Paradise even though you have not known what the others before you have gone through? They had suffered affliction and loss, and were shaken and tossed about so that even the Apostle had to cry out with his followers: "When will the help of God arrive?" Remember, the help of God is ever at hand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith. A maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her. And do not marry your daughters to idolaters until they accept the faith. A servant who is a believer is better than an idolater even though you may like him. They invite you to Hell, but God calls you to Paradise and pardon by His grace. And He makes His signs manifest that men may haply take heed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Divorce is (revokable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are two ways open for husbands), either (to) keep (the wives) honourably, or part with them in a decent way. You are not allowed to take away the least of what you have given your wives, unless both of you fear that you would not be able to keep within the limits set by God. If you fear you cannot maintain the bounds fixed by God, there will be no blame on either if the woman redeems herself. Do not exceed the limits of God, for those who exceed the bounds set by God are transgressors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a man divorces her again (a third time), she becomes unlawful for him (and he cannot remarry her) until she has married another man. Then if he divorces her there is no harm if the two unite again if they think they will keep within the bounds set by God and made clear for those who understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you have divorced your wives, and they have reached the end of the period of waiting, then keep them honourably (by revoking the divorce), or let them go with honour, and do not detain them with the intent of harassing lest you should transgress. He who does so will wrong himself. Do not mock the decrees of God, and remember the favours God has bestowed on you, and revealed to you the Book and the Law to warn you of the consequences of doing wrong. Have fear of God, and remember, God is cognisant of everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably. This warning is for those among you who believe in God and the Last Day. This is both proper and right for you, for God knows and you do not know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mothers should suckle their babies for a period of two years for those (fathers) who wish that they should complete the suckling, in which case they should feed them and clothe them in a befitting way; but no soul should be compelled beyond capacity, neither the mother made to suffer for the child nor the father for his offspring. The same holds good for the heir of the father (if he dies). If they wish to wean the child by mutual consent there is no harm. And if you wish to engage a wet nurse you may do so if you pay her an agreed amount as is customary. But fear God, and remember that God sees all that you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no harm in proposing in secret to (any of) these women, or keeping the intention to yourself: God is aware that you will keep them in mind. Yet do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper; and do not resolve upon marriage till the fixed term of waiting is over. Remember that God knows what is in your hearts; so be fearful of Him, and remember that God is forgiving and forbearing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And if you divorce them before the consummation of marriage, but after settling the dowry, then half the settled dowry must be paid, unless the woman forgoes it, or the person who holds the bond of marriage pays the full amount. And if the man pays the whole, it is nearer to piety. But do not forget to be good to each other, and remember that God sees all that you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When Saul led his armies, he said: "God will test you by a stream. Whoever drinks its water will not be of me; but those who do not drink shall be on my side. The only exception will be those who scoop up a palmful of water with their hands." And but for a few they all drank of its water. When they had crossed it, and those who believed with him, they said: "We have no strength to combat Goliath and his forces today. But those who believed they have to face their Lord, said:" Many a time has a small band defeated a large horde by the will of God. God is with those who are patient (and persevere). "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And when they were facing Goliath and his hordes they prayed: "O Lord, give us endurance and steady our steps, and help us against the deniers of truth."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
By the will of God they defeated them, and David killed Goliath, and God gave him kingship and wisdom, and taught him whatsoever He pleased. If God did not make men deter one another this earth would indeed be depraved. But gracious is God to the people of the world.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of all these apostles We have favoured some over the others. God has addressed some of them, and the stations of some have been exalted over the others. And to Jesus, son of Mary, We gave tokens, and reinforced him with divine grace. If God had so willed those who came after them would never have contended when clear signs had come to them. But dissensions arose, some believed, some denied. And if God had willed they would never have fought among themselves. But God does whatsoever He please.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no compulsion in matter of faith. Distinct is the way of guidance now from error. He who turns away from the forces of evil and believes in God, will surely hold fast to a handle that is strong and unbreakable, for God hears all and knows everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you thought of the man who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had given him a kingdom? When Abraham said: "My Lord is the giver of life and death," he replied: "I am the giver of life and death." And Abraham said: "God makes the sun rise from the East; so you make it rise from the West," and dumbfounded was the infidel. God does not guide those who are unjust.

Or take the man who passed by a town which lay destroyed upside down. He said: "How can God restore this city now that it is destroyed?" So God made him die for a hundred years, then brought him back to life, and inquired: "How long did you stay in this state?" "A day or less than a day," he replied. "No," He said, "you were dead a hundred years, yet look at your victuals, they have not decomposed; and look at your ass! We shall make you a warning for men. And regard the bones, how We raise them and clothe them with flesh." When this became clear to him, the man said: "Indeed God has power over all things."

Those who spend in the way of God, and having spent do not boast or give pain (by word or deed), will get their reward from their Lord, and will neither have fear nor regret.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Saying a word that is kind, and forgiving is better than charity that hurts. (Do not forget that) God is affluent and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does any of you wish to have an orchard full of date - palm trees and vines, and streams of running water and fruits of all kinds, and then old age should overtake him while his children are small, and a scorching whirlwind should smite and burn it down? Thus God makes His signs clear to you that you may reflect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He gives wisdom to whomsoever He please; and those who are bestowed wisdom get good in abundance. Yet none remembers this save men of wisdom.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whatsoever you give away in alms or vow as offering, is all known to God; but the wicked will have none to help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is not for you to guide them: God guides whom He will. Whatever you spend you will do so for yourself, for you will do so to seek the way that leads to God; and what you spend in charity you will get back in full, and no wrong will be done to you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O believers, when you negotiate a debt for a fixed term, draw up an agreement in writing, though better it would be to have a scribe write it faithfully down; and no scribe should refuse to write as God has taught him, and write what the borrower dictates, and have fear of God, his Lord, and not leave out a thing. If the borrower is deficient of mind or infirm, or unable to explain, let the guardian explain judiciously; and have two of your men to act as witnesses; but if two men are not available, then a man and two women you approve, so that in case one of them is confused the other may prompt her. When the witnesses are summoned they should not refuse (to come). But do not neglect to draw up a contract, big or small, with the time fixed for paying back the debt. This is more equitable in the eyes of God, and better as evidence and best for avoiding doubt. But if it is a deal about some merchandise requiring transaction face to face, there is no harm if no (contract is drawn up) in writing. Have witnesses to the deal, (and make sure) that the scribe or the witness is not harmed. If he is, it would surely be sinful on your part. And have fear of God, for God gives you knowledge, and God is aware of everything.

If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, pledge your goods (against the Loan); and if one trusts the other, then let him who is trusted deliver the thing entrusted, and have fear of God, his Lord. Do not suppress any evidence, for he who conceals evidence is sinful of heart; and God is aware of all you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Prophet believes in what has been revealed to him by his Lord, and so do the faithful. Each one believes in God and His angels, His Books and the prophets, and We make no distinction between the apostles. For they say: "We hear and obey, and we seek Your forgiveness, O Lord, for to You we shall journey in the end."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God does not burden a soul beyond capacity. Each will enjoy what (good) he earns, as indeed each will suffer from (the wrong) he does. Punish us not, O Lord, if we fail to remember or lapse into error. Burden us not, O Lord, with a burden as You did those before us. Impose not upon us a burden, O Lord, we cannot carry. Overlook our trespasses and forgive us, and have mercy upon us; You are our Lord and Master, help us against the clan of unbelievers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will gather mankind together, O Lord, on a day that is certain to come, and God does not fail in His promise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As for those who deny, neither their wealth nor their children will help them in the least against God. They shall be but faggots for (the fire of) Hell,

There was a token for you in the two armies which clashed (in the battle of Badr), one fighting for God, the other of unbelievers who saw with their own eyes the faithful to be two times as many as they, for God reinforces with His help whomsoever He will. In this is a lesson for those who have eyes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Their good deeds will be wasted in this world and in the next, and none will they have to help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How shall it be when We gather them together on a day that is certain to come, when each will receive his reward without (favour or) wrong?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You make the night succeed the day, the day succeed the night, raise the living from the dead, the dead from the living, and give whomsoever You please, and in measure without number. "

The angels said: "O Mary, indeed God has favoured you and made you immaculate, and chosen you from all the women of the world.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I (have come to) confirm the truth of the Torah which was sent down before me, and make certain things lawful which have been forbidden until now; and I come to you with a sign from your Lord; so be fearful of God and follow me.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When Jesus perceived their unbelief he asked: "Who will help me in the way of God?" "We," the disciples answered, "shall be the helpers of God. We believe in God; and you be our witness that we submit and obey.

Those who are infidels will surely receive severe punishment both in this world and the next; and none will they have to help (or save) them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tell those who dispute this with you even after the knowledge that has reached you: "Come, let us gather our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves, and pray and solicit God to condemn those who lie."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tell them: "O people of the Book, let us come to an agreement on that which is common between us, that we worship no one but God, and make none His compeer, and that none of us take any others for lord apart from God." If they turn away you tell them: "Bear witness that we submit to Him."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He will surely not bid you make the angels and the prophets your lords. Would he order you disbelief after you have submitted (and accepted the law of God)?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember when God covenanted the prophets (and said): "If after I have given you the Law and the judgement there comes an apostle to you who confirms the truth already with you, you will surely believe him and help him;" and asked: "Do you accept and agree to the terms of My covenant?" They said: "We accept." "Then you be witness," said God, "and I shall be witness with you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "We believe in God, and in what has been revealed to us, and in what had been sent down to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their offspring, and what had been revealed to Moses and to Jesus and to all other prophets by their Lord. We make no distinction between them, and we submit to Him and obey."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
From those who deny and die disbelieving will never be accepted an earthful of gold if proferred by them as ransom. For them is grievous punishment, and none will help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hold on firmly together to the rope of God, and be not divided among yourselves, and remember the favours God bestowed on you when you were one another 's foe and He reconciled your hearts, and you turned into brethren through His grace. You had stood on the edge of a pit of fire and He saved you from it, thus revealing to you His clear signs that you may find the right way perchance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let there be a body among you who may call to the good, enjoin what is esteemed and forbid what is odious. They are those who will be successful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will do you no harm but annoyance; and if they fight you they will only turn their backs, then no help will reach them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Degraded they shall live wheresoever they be unless they make an alliance with God and alliance with men, for they have incurred the anger of God, and misery overhangs them. That is because they denied the signs of God and killed the prophets unjustly, and rebelled, and went beyond the limit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O believers, do not make others except your own people your confidants. They will spare no effort to ruin you: They surely desire your annihilation. Hate is on their tongues, and what they hide in their hearts is worse. We have shown you the signs if you have sense.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For God had helped you during the Battle of Badr at a time when you were helpless. So act in compliance with the laws of God; you may well be grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember when you said to the faithful: "Is it not sufficient that your Lord should send for your help three thousand angels from the heavens?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nor did they say aught but: "O our Lord, forgive us our sins and excesses in our acts, and steady our steps, and help us against unbelieving people."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O believers, if you listen to the infidels they will make you turn your backs, and you will be the losers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But God is your protector, and He is the best of helpers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The promise made to you by God was verified when you destroyed (the foe) by His leave, until you were unmanned and disputed the order, and thus disobeyed (the Apostle) even after He had brought you in sight of (victory) you longed for. Some of you desired this world, and some of you the next. Then He put you to flight before (them) in order to try you. But (now) He has forgiven you, for surely God is kind to the faithful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then after affliction He Sent you a drowsiness as comes after security, overwhelming some among you, and making some anxious for themselves, and made them think thoughts of pagan ignorance; and they said: "Have we a say in any affair?" Say: "All affairs rest with God." They hide in their hearts what they do not disclose to you. They say: "If we had a say in the affair we would not have been killed in this place." Tell them: "Even had you stayed at home, those of you who were ordained to fight would have gone to their place of (eternal) rest. God had to try them to bring out what they concealed in their breasts, and to bring out the secrets of their hearts, for God knows your innermost thoughts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If God is there to help you none will overcome you; and if He forsake you, who will help you other than Him? So only in God should the faithful place their trust.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If God is there to help you none will overcome you; and if He forsake you, who will help you other than Him? So only in God should the faithful place their trust.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Never think that those who are killed in the way of God are dead. They are alive, getting succour from their Lord,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has indeed heard the words of those who said: "God is a pauper whereas we are rich." We shall make a note of their words, and the murders of the prophets they committed unjustly, and say to them: "Now taste the agony of burning."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every soul will know the taste of death. You will get your recompense in full on the Day of Resurrection; and he who is spared the Fire and finds his way to Paradise will meet his desire. As for the life of this world, it is nothing but a merchandise of vanity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And remember when God took a promise from the people of the Book to make its (truth) known to mankind, and not keep back any part of it, they set aside (the pledge), and sold it away for a little gain but how wretched the bargain that they made!

Those who honour God in meditation, standing or sitting or lying on their sides, who reflect and contemplate on the creation of the heavens and the earth, (and say) "Not in vain have You made them. All praise be to You, O Lord, preserve us from the torment of Hell.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whoever, O Lord, should be cast into Hell shall be verily disgraced; and the sinners shall have none to help (or save) them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Give to the orphans their possessions, and do not replace things of your own which are bad with things which are good among theirs, and do not intermix their goods with your own and make use of them, for this is a grievous crime.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As for the children, God decrees that the share of the male is equivalent to that of two females. If they consist of women only, and of them more than two, they will get two - thirds of the inheritance; but in case there is one, she will inherit one half. The parents will each inherit a sixth of the estate if it happens the deceased has left a child; but if he has left no children, and his parents are his heirs, then the mother will inherit one - third; but if he has left brothers, the mother will inherit one - sixth after payment of legacies and debts. Of parents and children you do not know who are more useful to you. These are the decrees of God who knows all and is wise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your share in the property the wives leave behind is half if they die without an issue, but in case they have left children, then your share is one - fourth after the payment of legacies and debts; and your wife shall inherit one - fourth of what you leave at death if you die childless, if not, she will get one - eighth of what you leave behind after payment of legacies and debts. If a man or a woman should die without leaving either children or parents behind but have brother and sister, they shall each inherit one - sixth. In case there are more, they will share one - third of the estate after payment of legacies and debts without prejudice to others. This is the decree of God who knows all and is kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If two (men) among you are guilty of such acts then punish both of them. But if they repent and reform, let them be, for God accepts repentance and is merciful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O believers, you are not allowed to take perforce the women (of dead relatives) into your heritage, or tyrannise over them in order to deprive them of what you have given them, unless they are guilty of open adultery. Live with them with tolerance and justice even if you do not care for them. For it may well be you may not like a thing, yet God may have endued it with much goodness.

Unlawful are your mothers and daughters and your sisters to you, and the sisters of your fathers and your mothers, and the daughters of your brothers and sisters, and foster mothers, foster sisters, and the mothers of your wives, and the daughters of the wives you have slept with who are under your charge; but in case you have not slept with them there is no offence (if you marry their daughters); and the wives of your own begotten sons; and marrying two sisters is unlawful. What happened in the past (is now past): God is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman (let him marry) a maid who is a believer. God is aware of your faith: The one of you is of the other; so marry them with the consent of their people, and give them an appropriate dowry. They are women (seeking) wedlock, and not lechery, nor secretly looking for paramours. But if they are married and guilty of adultery, inflict on them half the punishment (enjoined) for gentlewomen. This is for those who are afraid of doing wrong. In case they can wait, it is better for them. God is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God wishes to make it clear to you and guide you through the example of earlier people, and to forgive you, for God is all - knowing and all - wise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pay homage to God, and make none His compeer, and be good to your parents and relatives, the orphans and the needy and the neighbours who are your relatives, and the neighbours who are strangers, and the friend by your side, the traveller and your servants and subordinates. God does not surely love those who are arrogant and boastful,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But God knows your enemies well: and sufficient is God to protect you, and sufficient is God for all help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indeed, by your Lord, they will not believe till they make you adjudge in their disputes and find no constraint in their minds about your decisions and accept them with full acquiescence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O believers, take precautions, and advance in detachments, or go all together in a body.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What has come upon you that you fight not in the cause of God and for the oppressed, men, women and children, who pray: "Get us out of this city, O Lord, whose people are oppressors; so send us a friend by Your will, and send us a helper."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you not seen the people who were told: "Hold back your hands (from attacking), observe your devotional obligations and pay the zakat?" But when they were commanded to fight, behold, a section among them were filled with fear of men as though it were the fear of God and even more, and said: "O Lord, why did you make war compulsory for us? Why did you not allow us to live a little more?" Say to them: "How short - lived is the commerce of this world; but that of the next is best for those who fear God; and you will not be wronged the breadth of a thread."

God: There is no god but He. He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection which is certain to come; and whose word is truer than God 's?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How is it that you are divided in two factions about the hypocrites? God has routed them for what they were doing. Do you wish to guide him to the path whom God has allowed to go astray? As for him whom God allows to go astray you will not find a way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They wish you to become disbelievers as they are, so that you should become like them. Therefore hold them not as friends until they go out of their homes in the way of God. If they do not, seize them wherever they are and do away with them. Do not make them your friends or allies,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But those who are helpless, men, women and children, who can neither contrive a plan nor do they know the way,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you are among them, and have to lead the service of prayer, let one group stand up with you, but let them keep their arms. After they have paid their homage they should go to the rear, and let the group which has not done so yet offer their service of prayer with you, remaining cautious and armed, The infidels wish to find you neglectful of your arms and provisions, to attack you unawares. It will not be a sin if you put aside your arms when you are troubled by rain, or you are ill; but take full precautions. God has reserved for infidels a despicable punishment

Whatever the promises he makes, whatever the desires he enkindles, and whatever the hopes Satan rouses in them, are no more than delusion.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And they ask you for judgement about women. Tell them: "God has given you instructions about them. You also read them in the Book concerning orphaned women (in your charge) to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage, as well as in respect of helpless children, that you should be just in the matter of orphans." The good you do is known to God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a woman fears aversion from her husband, or ill treatment, there is no harm if they make a peaceful settlement; and peace is an excellent thing. But men keep self - interest uppermost. Yet if you do good and fear God, God is cognisant of all that you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You have been commanded in the Book that whensoever you hear God 's messages denied or derided, do not sit in that company until they begin talking of other things, or you will be no different from them. Indeed God will put the hypocrites and infidels together in Hell.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of Hell, and you will find none to help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But those who believe in God and His apostles and make no distinction among any of them, will be given by Him their recompense; for God is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The people of the Book demand of you to bring for them a book from heaven. But of Moses they had asked a bigger thing, and demanded: "Show us God face to face." They were struck by lightning then as punishment for their wickedness. Even then they made the calf, when clear signs had reached them. Still We forgave them and gave Moses clear authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O people of the Book, do not be fanatical in your faith, and say nothing but the truth about God. The Messiah who is Jesus, son of Mary, was only an apostle of God, and a command of His which He sent to Mary, as a mercy from Him. So believe in God and His apostles, and do not call Him 'Trinity'. Abstain from this for your own good; for God is only one God, and far from His glory is it to beget a son. All that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him; and sufficient is God for all help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then those who believed and earned good deeds will be given their recompense in full, and even more out of grace. But those who disdain and who boast will receive a painful punishment. They will find none except God to help them or save them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They ask you for judgement about 'Kalalah' (a man who dies childless). Say: "God has given a decision in the matter of inheritance." If a man dies and leaves no child behind but have a sister, she will get a half of what he owned, as he would have done the whole of what she possessed if she had died a childless person. In ease he has two sisters then they will get two - thirds of the heritage. But if he has both brothers and sisters, the male will inherit a share equal to that of two females. God makes this manifest to you lest you wander astray, for God has knowledge of everything.

O you who believe, do not violate the (sanctity of) offerings to God, nor the rites of the holy month, nor sacrificial cattle with garlands (that are brought to the Ka 'bah), nor of the people who flock to the Holy House seeking the bounties of their Lord, and His pleasure. Hunt when you have laid aside the robe of the pilgrim. And do not let your hatred of a people who had barred you from the Holy Mosque lead you to aggression. But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God. Surely God is severe in punishment.

On this day all things that are clean have been made lawful for you; and made lawful for you is the food of the people of the Book, as your food is made lawful for them. And lawful are the chaste Muslim women, and the women of the people of the Book who are chaste, (for marriage) and not fornication or liaison, if you give them their dowries. Useless shall be rendered the acts of those who turn back on their faith, and they will be among the losers in the life to come.

O you who believe, stand up as witnesses for God in all fairness, and do not let the hatred of a people deviate you from justice. Be just: This is closest to piety; and beware of God. Surely God is aware of all you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has made a promise of forgiveness and the highest reward to those who believe and perform good deeds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they dishonoured their pledge We condemned them, and hardened their hearts. So they distort the words of the Scripture out of context, and have forgotten some of what they were warned against. You will always hear of treachery on their part except that of a few. But forbear and forgive them, for God loves those who do good.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We had taken the pledge of those also who call themselves Christians. But they too forgot to take advantage of the warning they were given. So We have caused enmity and hatred among them to last till the Day of Resurrection, when God will inform them of what they were doing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember when Moses said to his people: "O my people, remember the favours that God bestowed on you when He appointed apostles from among you, and made you kings and gave you what had never been given to any one in the world.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But why should they make you a judge when the Torah is with them which contains the Law of God? Even then they turn away. They are those who will never believe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And to you We have revealed the Book containing the truth, confirming the earlier revelations, and preserving them (from change and corruption). So judge between them by what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, side - stepping the truth that has reached you. To each of you We have given a law and a way and a pattern of life. If God had pleased He could surely have made you one people (professing one faith). But He wished to try and test you by that which He gave you. So try to excel in good deeds. To Him will you all return in the end, when He will tell you of what you were at variance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O believers, do not hold Jews and Christians as your allies. They are allies of one another; and anyone who makes them his friends is surely one of them; and God does not guide the unjust.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O believers, do not make friends with those who mock and make a sport of your faith, who were given the Book before you, and with unbelievers; and fear God if you truly believe;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They are surely infidels who say: "God is the Christ, son of Mary." But the Christ had only said: "O children of Israel, worship God who is my Lord and your Lord." Whosoever associates a compeer with God, will have Paradise denied to him by God, and his abode shall be Hell; and the sinners will have none to help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O believers, do not forbid the good things God has made lawful for you; and do not transgress. God does not love transgressors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God does not punish you but for what you swear in earnest. The expiation (for breaking an oath) is feeding ten persons who are poor, with food that you give your own families, or clothing them, or freeing a slave. But he who cannot do so should fast for three days. This is the expiation for an oath when you have sworn it. So abide by your oaths. Thus God makes His commandments clear to you: You may perhaps be grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has made the Ka 'bah, the Sacred House, a means of support for mankind, as also the holy month, the sacrificial offerings, and consecrated cattle, so that you may understand that known to God is all that is in the heavens and the earth, and God has knowledge of everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O believers, do not ask about things which, if made known to you, may vex you. But if you ask about them when the Qur 'an is being revealed they will be unfolded to you. God has overlooked (your failings) in this (respect), for God is forgiving and forbearing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, let two honest men among you be witness when you dictate your last will and testament as (the hour of) death draws near; and if death approaches while you are on a journey, two men other than yours. Detain them after the service of prayer, and if you doubt their word make them swear by God that: "We shall not take a bribe even though it be offered by a near relative, nor hide the testimony of God, for then we shall surely be sinful."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is thus likely that men will bear witness rightly, or else fear that their oaths may be disproved by oaths given after them. So fear God, and do not forget that God does not guide the iniquitous.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day God will gather the apostles and ask: "What answer was made to you?" They will say: "We know not. You alone know the secrets unknown."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And when God will say: "O Jesus, son of Mary, remember the favours I bestowed on you and your mother, and reinforced you with divine grace that you spoke to men when in the cradle, and when in the prime of life; when I taught you the law and the judgement and the Torah and the Gospel; when you formed the state of your people 's destiny out of mire and you breathed (a new spirit) into it, and they rose by My leave; when you healed the blind by My leave, and the leper; when you put life into the dead by My will; and when I held back the children of Israel from you when you brought to them My signs, and the disbelievers among them said:" Surely these are nothing but pure magic. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALL PRAISE BE to God who created the heavens and the earth, and ordained darkness and light. Yet the unbelievers make the others equal of their Lord.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do they not see how many generations We laid low before them, whom We had firmly established in the land as We have not established you, and showered abundant rain on them, and made rivers lap at their feet, yet whom We destroyed for their sins, and raised new generations after them?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day We shall gather all of them together and say to those who ascribe (partners to God): "Where are the compeers who you claimed (were equal to God)?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many an apostle has been accused of lies before you. Yet they bore with fortitude the falsehoods and the hurt until our help arrived. There is no changing the word of God: The news of (past) apostles has come to you already.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
No: You will call to Him alone; and He will, if He please, remove (the distress) for which you had called Him; and forget those you associate as compeers (with Him)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then why did they not submit when Our punishment came upon them? But their hearts were hardened, and Satan made things they were doing look attractive to them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He indeed who sends you to death at night, and knows what you do in the day, then makes you rise with it again in order that the fixed term of life be fulfilled. Then to Him you will be returned when He will tell you what you did.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you see them argue about Our messages, withdraw from their company until they begin to talk of other things. In case the Devil makes you forget, leave the company of these unjust people the moment you remember this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leave those alone who have made a sport and frolic of their faith, and have been seduced by the life of this world. Remind them hereby lest a man is doomed for what he has done. He will have none to help him, or intercede for him, other than God; and even if he offer all the ransoms they will not be accepted from him. They are those who will be destroyed by their own acts. There will be scalding water to drink for them and painful punishment, for they had disbelieved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: 'Should we call in place of God one who can neither help nor do us harm, and turn back after having been guided by God, like a man beguiled by the devils who wanders perplexed in the wilderness while his friends call him back to the right path, saying:' Come to us, this way? 'Say: "God' s guidance is (true) guidance, and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But they failed to make a just estimation of God when they said: "He did not reveal to any man any thing." Ask them: "Who then revealed the Book that Moses brought, - - a guidance and light for men, - - which you treat as sheafs of paper, which you display, yet conceal a great deal, though through it you were taught things you did not know before, nor even your fathers knew?" Say: "God," and leave them to the sport of engaging in vain discourse.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"You have come before Us all alone," (God will say), "as when you were created first, leaving behind all that We had bestowed on you. We do not see your intercessors with you who, you imagined, had partnership with you. Shattered lie your ties with them now, and gone are the claims you made."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He ushers in the dawn, and made the night for rest, the sun and moon a computation. Such is the measure appointed by Him, the omnipotent and all - wise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made the stars by which you reckon your way through the darkness of the desert and the sea. Distinct have We made Our signs for those who recognise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made the stars by which you reckon your way through the darkness of the desert and the sea. Distinct have We made Our signs for those who recognise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who produced you from a single cell, and appointed a place of sojourning, (the womb of the mother), and a place of depositing, (the grave). How clear have We made Our signs for those who understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To you have come signs from your Lord, (and the light of understanding). So any one who sees (and understands) does so for himself, and any one who turns blind shall suffer the consequences alone. (Say:) "I am not a guardian over you (to make you understand)."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus in varied ways We explain Our signs so that they may say: "You have been instructed," and that We might make it clear to those who understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not revile those who invoke others apart from God, lest they begin to revile God out of malice and ignorance. We have made attractive their deeds to every people. They have to go back to their Lord, when He will tell them what they used to do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is how We have made for each apostle opponents, the satans among men and jinns, who inspire one another with deceitful talk. But if your Lord had willed they would not have done so. Pay no attention to them and to what they fabricate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let those who do not believe in the life to come, listen to it and be pleased with it, and let them gain what they may gain.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And why should you not eat of that over which the name of God has been pronounced, when He has made it distinctly clear what is forbidden, unless you are constrained to do so. Surely many (men) mislead others into following their vain desires through lack of knowledge. Your Lord certainly knows the transgressors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can he who was lifeless, to whom We gave life, and gave him a light in whose glow he walks among men, be like him who is used to darkness from which he can never emerge? Thus have been their doings made attractive to unbelievers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus God guides whomsoever He please by opening wide his breast to surrender; and Straitens the breasts of those He allows to go astray, (who feel suffocated) as if they were ascending the skies. Thus will God punish those who do not believe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the straight path of your Lord. Distinct have We made Our signs for those who reflect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the day He will gather them together, (He will say:) "O you assembly of jinns, you made great use of men." But their proteges among men will say: "O our Lord, we lived a life of mutual gain, but have now reached the term You ordained for us." "Your abode is Hell," He will say, "where you will dwell for ever, unless God please otherwise." Verily your Lord is wise and all - knowing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Lord is all - sufficient and full of benevolence. He can take you away if He please, and make whom He will succeed you, as He had raised you from the progeny of others.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The promise that was made to you is bound to be fulfilled. It is not in your power to defeat it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They allocate a share from God 's own created fields and cattle to God, and they say: "This is God' s" - - or so they think - - "and that, of the compeers of God," so that what belongs to the compeers does not reach God, but that which is God 's may reach the compeers (set up by them). How bad is the judgement that they make!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They also say: "These cattle and these crops are consecrated. None may eat of them other than those we permit," - - so they assert. "And the use of these cattle is forbidden for carrying burden." They do not pronounce the name of God on certain animals, inventing lies against Him. He will punish them for what they fabricate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made unlawful for the Jews all animals with claws or nails, and the fat of the oxen and sheep, except that on their backs or their intestines, or which remains attached to their bones. This was the punishment for their insubordination; and what We say is true.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tell them: "Bring your witnesses to testify that God has forbidden this (and this)." Then even if they testify, you should not testify with them; and do not follow the wishes of those who deny Our signs and believe not in the Hereafter, and make others the equal of their Lord.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tell them: "Come, I will read out what your Lord has made binding on you: That you make none the equal of God, and be good to your parents, and do not abandon your children out of poverty, for We give you food and We shall provide for them; and avoid what is shameful, whether open or hidden, and do not take a life which God has forbidden, unless for some just cause. These things has God enjoined on you. Haply you may understand.

These things has God enjoined on you. Haply you may understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not spend the belongings of the orphans but for their betterment, until they come of age; and give in full measure, and weigh justly on the balance. God does not burden a soul beyond capacity. When you say a thing, let it be just, even though the matter relate to a relative of yours, and fulfil a promise made to God. These are the things that He has enjoined that you may take heed.

It is He who made you trustees on the earth, and exalted some in rank over others in order to try you by what He has given you. Indeed your Lord 's retribution is swift, yet He is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O sons of Adam, let not Satan beguile you as he did your parents out of Eden, and made them disrobe to expose their disgrace to them. For he and his host can see you from where you cannot see them. We have made the devils the friends of those who do not believe,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

And the inmates of Paradise will call to the residents of Hell: "We have found that the promise made to us by our Lord was true. Have you also found the promise of your Lord to be true?" They will answer: "Yes (it is so)." Then a crier will call from among them: "The curse of God be on the vile,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Who obstruct those who follow the path of God and try to make it oblique, who do not believe in the life to come."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Who made a sport and frolic of their faith and were lured by the life of the world." As they had forgotten the meeting of this Day so shall We neglect them today for having rejected Our signs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Who made a sport and frolic of their faith and were lured by the life of the world." As they had forgotten the meeting of this Day so shall We neglect them today for having rejected Our signs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indeed We had brought to them a Book distinct, replete with knowledge, and guidance and grace for men who believe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are they waiting for the exposition of what it speaks of? The day that (Reality) is unravelled, the people who had lost sight of it will say: "The apostles of our Lord had indeed brought the truth. Do we have any one to intercede for us? If only we could go back to the world, we would act otherwise." Indeed they have caused themselves harm, and the lies they concocted did not help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you wonder that a warning has come to you from your Lord through a man who is one of you and warns you? Remember, He made you leaders after the people of Noah, and gave you a greater increase in your stature. So think of the favours of God; you may haply be blessed. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember, how you were made leaders after the people of 'Ad, and were settled on the land so that you could construct on the plains palaces, and carve dwellings out of mountains. So think of the favours of God, and do not act with corruption in the land. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
His people made no answer, and only said: "Drive them out of the city. They profess to be pure."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But when We changed hardship to ease, and they rose and prospered, (they forgot Our favours) and said: "Our ancestors had also known suffering and joy." So We caught them unawares.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I am duty bound to speak nothing of God but the truth I have brought from your Lord a clear sign; so let the people of Israel depart with me."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We said to Moses: "Throw down your staff;" and it swallowed up their conjurations in no time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the leaders of Pharaoh 's people said to him: "Would you allow Moses and his people to create disorder in the land and discard you and your gods?" He replied: "We shall now slay their sons and spare their women, and subdue them."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Said Moses to his people: "Invoke the help of God and be firm. The earth belongs to God: He can make whom He wills among His creatures inherit it. The future is theirs who take heed for themselves."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Said Moses to his people: "Invoke the help of God and be firm. The earth belongs to God: He can make whom He wills among His creatures inherit it. The future is theirs who take heed for themselves."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They said: "We were oppressed before you came, and have been since you have come to us." He answered: "It may well be that soon God may destroy your enemy and make you inherit the land, and then see how you behave."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We let loose on them floods and locusts, and vermin, frogs and blood - - how many different signs. But they still remained arrogant, for they were a people full of sin.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yet when punishment overtook them, they said: "O Moses, invoke your Lord for us as you have been enjoined. If the torment is removed, we shall certainly believe in you and let the people of Israel go with you."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But no sooner was the punishment withdrawn for a time to enable them to make good their promise than they broke it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We then made the people who were weak (and oppressed) successors of the land to the East and the West which We had blessed. Thus the fair promise of your Lord to the children of Israel was fulfilled, for they were patient in adversity; and whatsoever the Pharaoh and his people had fashioned, and the structures they had raised, were destroyed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When We brought the children of Israel across the sea, and they came to a people who were devoted to their idols, they said: "O Moses, make us also a god like theirs." "You are ignorant," he replied.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made an appointment of thirty nights with Moses (On Mount Sinai) to which We added ten more; so the term set by the Lord was completed in forty nights. Moses said to Aaron, his brother: "Deputise for me among my people. Dispose rightly, and do not follow the way of the authors of evil."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We wrote down on tablets admonitions and clear explanations of all things for Moses, and ordered him: "Hold fast to them, and command your people to observe the best in them. I will show you the abode of the wicked.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When Moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved, he said: "How wickedly you behaved in my absence. Why must you hasten the decree of your Lord?" And he cast aside the tablets, and pulled his brother by the hair. "O son of my mother," said (Aaron), "these people took advantage of my weakness and almost killed me. Do not let my enemies rejoice at my plight, and do not put me down among transgressors."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When his anger subsided Moses picked up the tablets. Inscribed on them was guidance and grace for those who fear their Lord.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who follow the messenger, the gentile Prophet, described in the Torah and the Gospel, who bids things noble and forbids things vile, makes lawful what is clean, and prohibits what is foul, who relieves them of their burdens, and the yoke that lies upon them. Those who believe and honour and help him, and follow the light sent with him, are those who will attain their goal. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We divided them into twelve (different) tribes. When his people asked for water, We said to Moses: "Strike the rock with your staff;" and behold, twelve springs of water gushed forth, so that each of the tribes had a place of its own to drink; and We made the clouds spread shade over them and sent for them manna and quails (and said): "Eat of the good things We have provided for you." But (by disobeying) they did not harm Us, they harmed themselves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But when they forgot to remember the warning, We saved those who prohibited evil, but inflicted on the wicked a dreadful punishment - - requital for their disobedience.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As for those who adhere to the Book and are firm in devotion, We shall certainly not let the wages of those who are upright to go waste.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When your Lord brings forth from their loins the offspring of the children of Adam, He makes them witnesses over themselves, (and asks): "Am I not your Lord?" 'Indeed,' they reply. 'We bear witness,' - - lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: "We were not aware of this;"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way, for He leaves them to wander perplexed in their wickedness.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who created you from a single cell, and from it created its mate, that you may live as companions. When the man covered the woman she conceived a light burden and carried it about. And when she was heavy (with child) they prayed together to their Lord: "If You bestow a healthy son on us we shall truly be grateful."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who can neither help them, nor help themselves?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who can neither help them, nor help themselves?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those whom you invoke besides God are created beings like you. So call on them and let them answer your call, if what you say is true.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
While those you beseech apart from Him cannot help you or even help themselves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
While those you beseech apart from Him cannot help you or even help themselves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And when you do not bring a (Qur 'anic) verse to them, they say: "Why don' t you make one up?" Say: "I follow only what my Lord reveals to me." These (revelations) are an evident proof from your Lord, and a guidance and grace for those who believe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember when you prayed to your Lord for help, He heard you and said: "I shall send a thousand angels following behind you for your aid."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That was that, but remember God will make the plots of the unbelievers contemptible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You had asked for a judgement, so the judgement has come to you (In the form of victory for the faithful). So, if you desist it will be better for you. If you come back to it, We shall do the same, and your forces, however large, will not be of the least avail, for God is with those who believe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If God had seen any good in them He would surely have made them hear. Now even if He makes them hear they will turn away (in obduracy).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If God had seen any good in them He would surely have made them hear. Now even if He makes them hear they will turn away (in obduracy).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember, when you were few and powerless in the land, afraid of despoliation at the hands of men. But then God sheltered and helped you to strength, and provided for you good things that you may perhaps be grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember, when the infidels contrived to make you a prisoner or to murder or expel you, they plotted, but God also planned; and God 's plan is the best.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That God may separate the bad from the good, and link the wicked together and cast them into Hell. These are verily the people who will lose.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But if they are obstinate, know that God is your helper and protector: How excellent a helper, and how excellent a protector is He!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But if they are obstinate, know that God is your helper and protector: How excellent a helper, and how excellent a protector is He!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you faced them He made (the enemy) seem few to you in numbers, and made you appear fewer in their eyes, (it was) so that God could accomplish what had been decreed; for all things rest with God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satan made their deeds look alluring to them, and said: "None will prevail over you this day, for I shall be near at hand." Yet when the two armies appeared face to face, he turned back and fled, saying: "I am not with you, for I can see what you cannot perceive. I fear God, for His punishment is severe."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As for those with whom you have made a treaty and who abrogate it every time, and do not fear God,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The infidels should not think that they can bypass (the law of God). Surely they cannot get away.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But if they are inclined to peace, make peace with them, and have trust in God, for He hears all and knows everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If they try to cheat you, God is surely sufficient for you. It is He who has strengthened you with His help and with believers

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who accepted the faith and set out of their homes, and fought in the way of God wealth and soul, and those who gave them shelter and helped them, are friends of one another. You are not responsible for protecting those who embraced the faith but did not leave their homes, until they do so. In ease they ask for your help in the name of faith, you are duty bound to help them, except against a people with whom you have a treaty; for God sees all that you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who accepted the faith and abandoned their homes, and struggled in the cause of God, and those who gave them shelter and helped them, are veritably true believers. For them is forgiveness and noble sustenance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A general proclamation is (made) this day of the Greater Pilgrimage on the part of God and His Apostle, that God is not bound (by any contract) to idolaters, nor is His Apostle. It is, therefore, better for you to repent. If you do not, remember that you cannot elude (the grip of) God. So announce to those who deny the truth the news of painful punishment,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Except those idolaters with whom you have a treaty, who have not failed you in the least, nor helped anyone against you. Fulfil your obligations to them during the term (of the treaty). God loves those who take heed for themselves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But when these months, prohibited (for fighting), are over, slay the idolaters wheresoever you find them, and take them captive or besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every likely place. But if they repent and fulfil their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, then let them go their way, for God is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fight them so that God may punish them at your hands, and put them to shame, and help you against them, and heal the wounds of the hearts of believers,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you think you will get away before God knows who among you fought and did not take anyone but God, His Apostle and the faithful, as their friends? God is cognisant of all that you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indeed God has helped you on many occasions, even during the battle of Hunain, when you were elated with joy at your numbers which did not prove of the least avail, so that the earth and its vast expanse became too narrow for you, and you turned back and retreated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Jews say: "Ezra is the son of God;" the Christians say: "Christ is the son of God." That is what they say with their tongues following assertions made by unbelievers before them. May they be damned by God: How perverse are they!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the true faith in order to make it superior to other systems of belief, even though the idolaters may not like it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intercalating a month is adding to unbelief. The unbelievers are misguided by this, for they take the same month to be sacred one year and sacrilegious the next, thus making the number of months sanctified by God accord with theirs in order to make what God has forbidden, lawful. Attractive seem to them their evil deeds; but God does not show the unbelievers the way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What has happened to you, O believers, that when you are asked to set out in the cause of God your feet begin to drag? Do you find the life of the world so pleasing that you forget the life to come? Yet the profit of the life of this world is but meagre as compared to the life to come.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you do not help (the Prophet, remember) God had helped him when the infidels had forced him to leave (and he was) one of two. When both of them were in the cave, he said to his companion: "Do not grieve, for God is with us." Then God sent divine peace on him, and invisible armies for his help, and made the unbelievers' purpose abject. Most exalted is God 's word, for God is all - mighty and all - wise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
May God forgive you. Why did you allow them (to stay behind) without ascertaining who spoke the truth and who were liars?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If they had intended to go out (to fight) they would surely have made preparations. But God did not like their setting forth, and they were held back and told: "Stay at home with those who stay behind."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had they gone out with you, they would only have been a hindrance and let loose confusion among you to create discord; for there are some in your midst who spy for them. But God knows who are the wicked.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are some among them who blame you (of partiality) in distributing the offerings made in the name of God. In case they receive some of these they are pleased, if not, they are incensed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not make excuses: You turned unbelievers after having come to faith. If We pardon a section of you (for being frivolous), We shall punish the other for being guilty (of deliberate sin).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They swear by God: "We never said this." But they surely said words disbelieving the truth, and they turned unbelievers after having come to faith, and designed what they could not accomplish. They did it only out of vengeance for God and His Apostle had enriched them by their grace. So, if they repent it is better for them. If they turn away then God would afflict them with painful punishment in this world and the next; and none will they have on the face of the earth to protect or help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of them made a covenant with God: "If You give us in Your bounty we shall give alms and be upright."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a consequence of breaking their promise made to God, and telling lies, he filled their hearts with hypocrisy which will last till the day they come before Him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let them laugh a little, for weep they will, more as retribution for what they have done.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And let not their wealth and children astonish you. God wishes to punish them through these in the world, and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They prefer to be with women who (are allowed to) stay at home during war, and their hearts are sealed; so they fail to understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those among the migrants (from Makkah) and helpers (in Madina) who were the first to believe, and those who followed them in goodness, have been accepted by God and they follow His way. For them He has gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever; and that is happiness supreme.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accept the offerings they make from their wealth in order to cleanse and purify them for progress, and invoke blessings upon them. Your blessings will surely bring them peace, for God hears all and knows everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has verily bought the souls and possessions of the faithful in exchange for a promise of Paradise. They fight in the cause of God, and kill and are killed. This is a promise incumbent on Him, as in the Torah, so the Gospel and the Qur 'an. And who is more true to his promise than God? So rejoice at the bargain you have made with Him; for this will be triumph supreme.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As for Abraham 's prayer for his father, he was fulfilling a promise he had made to him. Yet when it became evident to him that (his father) was an enemy of God, he broke away from him, though Abraham was soft hearted and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God never leads men astray after guiding them, until He makes quite clear to them what they should avoid, for God indeed knows each and everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verily God 's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He alone is the giver of life and death; and none do you have besides God as friend and helper.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God was kind to the Prophet, the emigrants, and the helpers of the faithful who followed him in the hour of distress. When a section of them were about to lose courage He turned to them in His mercy, for He is compassionate and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was not worthy of the people of Madina, and the Arabs of the desert around them, to abandon the Prophet of God, and to care more for themselves than for him; for there is no hardship or thirst or hunger that they know in the service of God, and no place they walk on where walking provokes the unbelievers, and no harm they receive from the enemy, but is put down as a good deed in their favour. Surely God does not let the recompense of those who do good to go waste.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O believers, fight the unbelievers around you, and let them realise that you are firm: Remember, God is with those who are pious and obedient to Him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When man is afflicted with adversity he calls to Us, whether lying on his side, or sitting or standing. But when We take away his troubles, he moves away, as though he had never called to Us in affliction. In the same way, attractive have been made their deeds to the prodigals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When Our clear messages are recited to them, those who do not hope to meet Us, say: "Bring a different Qur 'an, or make amendments to this one." Say: "It is not for me to change it of my will. I follow (only) what is revealed to me. If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of an awful Day."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When We let them taste Our mercy after affliction, they contrive against Our signs. Say: "God is swifter at contriving," for Our angels record everything you plan.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day We shall gather them all together We shall say to the idolaters: "Take your stand with the compeers you worshipped as the equals of God." We shall then create a rift between them, and the compeers will say: "You did not worship us;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do they say (of the Prophet) that: "He has composed it?" Say to them: "Bring a Surah like this, and call anyone apart from God you can (to help you), if what you say is true."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of them listen to you: But can you make the deaf hear who do not understand a thing?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day He will gather them together it will appear to them that they had lived (in the world) but an hour of a day to make each other 's acquaintance. Verily those who deny the meeting with God will be lost, and not find the way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is He who made the night for you to rest, and made the day enlightening. Indeed there are signs in this for those who listen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made the night for you to rest, and made the day enlightening. Indeed there are signs in this for those who listen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They say: "God has begotten a son." Immaculate is He and self - sufficient. "Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. You have no proof for this (assertion): Why do you say things of God you do not know?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let them profit by the world (while they may): In the end they will come back to Us. Then We shall make them taste severe punishment for having denied (the truth).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recount to them the story of Noah when he said to his people: "O people, if you find my staying with you and warning through God 's signs, unbearable to you, know that I have reposed my trust in God. So plan your move, and call your associates, and make certain of your plan; then do whatever you intend against me, allowing me no respite.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They answered: "We have placed our trust in God. O Lord, do not make us a target of oppression for these tyrannical people,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They answered: "We have placed our trust in God. O Lord, do not make us a target of oppression for these tyrannical people,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We commanded Moses and his brother: "Build homes for your people in Egypt, and make your houses places of worship, perform your acts of prayer and give happy tidings to those who believe."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why has there been no habitation that believed and profited by their faith, except the people of Jonah? When they came to believe, We removed from them the affliction of shame in the world, and made them prosperous for a time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "O men, if you have doubt about my faith, then (know) I do not worship those you worship apart from God, but I worship God who makes you die; and I am commanded to be a believer,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And not to invoke any other than God, who can neither help nor hurt me; for if I do, I would surely be unjust.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If We allow man to enjoy Our favours, and then take them away from him, he becomes despondent and ungrateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If We let him taste Our favours after adversity, he says: "Misfortune has left me," and begins to brag and exult,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do they say (of the Prophet): "He has forged (the Qur 'an)?" Say: "Then bring ten Surahs like it, and call anyone except God to help you, if what you say is true."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He said: "O my people, think. If I have a clear proof from my Lord, and He has bestowed on me His grace, though unknown to you, can we force it upon you when you are averse?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I shall go up a mountain," he said, "which will keep me from the water." "There is no getting away," said Noah, "from the decree of God today, except for those on whom be His mercy." And a wave came between them, and he was among those who were drowned.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then it was said: "O earth, swallow back your water; and, O sky, desist." And the water subsided, and the decree was accomplished. The ark came to rest on Judi (Mount Ararat), and it was said: "Away with the cursed people!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So when Our angels came to Lot, he grieved for them, and felt powerless to help them, and said: "This is a day of sorrow.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this surely is a sign for him who fears the torment of the Hereafter, the day when mankind will be assembled together, which will be a day when all things would become evident.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not lean towards the wicked, or you will be caught in the flames of Hell, and have none to befriend you other than God, nor will you be given help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Be steadfast, for verily God does not let the reward of those who are upright and do good to go waste.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If only there had been men endued with virtue in the ages before you, who could preserve men from doing evil in the world, other than the few We saved from among them. Those who were wicked followed that which made them dissolute, and became sinners.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But if your Lord had pleased He could have made all human beings into one community of belief. But they would still have differed from one another,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let us kill Joseph or cast him in some distant land so that we may get our father 's exclusive affection; then play innocent. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They showed him the shirt with false blood on it. (Their father) said: "It is not so; you have made up the story. Yet endurance is best. I seek the help of God alone for what you impute."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A caravan happened to pass, and sent the water - carrier to bring water from the well. He let down his bucket (and pulled Joseph up with it). "What luck," said the man; "here is a boy;" and they hid him as an item of merchandise; but what they did was known to God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And (Joseph) asked the man he knew would be released: "Remember me to your lord;" but Satan made him forget to mention this to his lord, and Joseph remained in prison for a number of years.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And (Joseph) asked the man he knew would be released: "Remember me to your lord;" but Satan made him forget to mention this to his lord, and Joseph remained in prison for a number of years.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then the servant, who of the two had been released, remembering (Joseph), said: "I will give you its interpretation; let me go for it."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(At this Joseph remarked:) "From this (the Minister) should know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that God does not surely let the wiles of those who betray ever succeed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus We gave Joseph authority in the land so that he lived wherever he liked. We bestow Our favours on whomsoever We please, and do not allow the reward of those who are good to go waste.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they came to Joseph he made his brother his guest, and said: "I am your brother. So do not grieve for what they had done."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When he had given them their provisions he put his goblet in his brother 's saddle - bag. Then a crier announced: "O men of the caravan, you are thieves."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We cannot find the master 's goblet. Whoever comes up with it will be given a camel - load of grain; I vouch for it."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they despaired of (persuading) him, they went aside to confer. The oldest of them said: "You know that your father has pledged you in the name of God, and you have been guilty of iniquity in the case of Joseph before. I will not leave this place unless my father permits or God decides for me, for He is the best of all judges.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"No," said (the father). "You have made up the story; but patience is best; God may bring them back to me. He is all - knowing and all - wise."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The caravan departed (from Egypt) and Jacob said (at home): "Say not that I am in my dotage, but I get the smell of Joseph."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He seated his parents by his side on the throne; and they fell down before him in homage. "O my father," said Joseph, "this is the meaning of my earlier dream. My Lord has made it come true. He was gracious in getting me out of the prison, and bringing you out of the desert to me after the discord created by Satan between me and my brothers, for my Lord is gracious to whomsoever He please. He is indeed all - knowing and all - wise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O my Lord, you have given me dominion and taught me the interpretation of dreams; O Creator of the heavens and the earth, You alone are my saviour in this world and the world to come; let me die submitting to You, and place me among the upright. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the apostles despaired and thought they were made false promises, Our help arrived, and We delivered whom We pleased; but never will Our punishment be averted from the sinners.

It is He who stretched the earth and placed upon it stabilisers and rivers; and made two of a pair of every fruit; (and) He covers up the day with the night. In these are signs for those who reflect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the earth are tracts adjoining one another, and vineyards, fields of corn and date - palm trees, some forked, some with single trunks, yet all irrigated by the self - same water, though We make some more excellent than the others in fruit. There are surely signs in them for those who understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who makes the lightning flash for fear and hope, and raises massive clouds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whosoever is in the heavens and on earth bows to God in submission with a will or perforce, as do their shadows in the morning and evening.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who keep together what God has ordained held together, and fear their Lord and dread the hardship of the Reckoning,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who keep together what God has ordained held together, and fear their Lord and dread the hardship of the Reckoning,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had there been a Qur 'an which could have made the mountains move, or the earth to cleave asunder, or the dead to speak, yet all authority belongs to God. Have the believers not learnt that if God had so willed He could have guided all mankind? As for unbelievers, they will be visited by misfortune endlessly for what they have done; or it would sit in their homes till the promised threat of God comes to pass. Surely God does not go back on His promise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many an apostle have they mocked before you; but I allowed the unbelievers respite, then I seized them. How severe was My punishment then!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who is it who stands (watch) over every soul for what it does? Yet they ascribe compeers to God. Say: "Then name them. Or are you announcing to God what He does not know on the earth? Or is it only empty talk? In fact, the unbelievers' plots are made to look attractive to them, so that they are held back from the right path. Whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whether We allow you to see (the punishment) We have promised them, or end your life before (its execution), it is certainly for you to convey the message; the reckoning is for Us to do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before him is Hell, and he will get putrid liquid to drink.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they will all appear before God together, the weak will say to those who were arrogant: "We were your followers, so can you now save us a little from God 's punishment?" They will say: "If we had been guided by God we would surely have shown you the way. To lament or endure is all the same to us now. No getting away is there for us."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the reckoning is over Satan will say: "The promise that was made to you by God was indeed a true promise; but I went back on the promise I had made, for I had no power over you except to call you; and you responded to my call. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. Neither can I help you nor can you give me help. I disavow your having associated me earlier (with God). The punishment for those who are wicked is painful indeed."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
With immutuble words God makes the faithful dauntless in the life of the world and the life to come, but leads the unjust into error, for God does as He pleases.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is God who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down rain from the sky producing fruits for your food thereby, and made you master of the ships that ply in the oceans by His command, subjected the rivers to your control,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember when Abraham prayed: "O Lord, make this a city of peace, and preserve me and my progeny from worshipping idols:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Think not God is oblivious of the deeds of the wicked. He has only allowed them respite till the Day on which all eyes would stare aghast,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Still they are plotting their plots, but evident are their plots to God, even though they are so adroit as to make the mountains move.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Think not that God would go back on His promise (made) to the apostles. Indeed God is mighty, the Lord of retribution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will see the wicked on that day bound together in chains.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We stretched the earth and placed upon it firm stabilisers, and made all things grow upon it balanced evenly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Lord will surely gather them together: Certainly He is all - wise and all - knowing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We shall cast out any grudge they may have in their hearts. (There) they will sit on couches face to face like brothers together.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"So leave with your family late in the night, yourself remaining in the rear, and let none turn back to look, and go where you will be commanded."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He created the cattle from whom you get warm clothing and (other) advantages, and some you eat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
With which He makes crops grow, and olives, dates and grapes and fruits of every kind for you. In this is a sign for those who think.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even if you are eager to guide them, God does not surely guide those who have gone astray: They will have no one to help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For (they fear) He might make what they differed about plain to them, and that the infidels may realise that they were liars.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have the plotters of mischief become unafraid that God will not split the earth to swallow them, or that punishment will not fall upon them from somewhere they do not (even) suspect?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And hides from people for shame at the news, (at a loss) whether he should keep her with shame, or bury her in the ground. How bad is the judgement that they make!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
By God, We sent apostles to many a people before you, but Satan made their acts seem attractive to them, and he is their friend this day, and a painful torment awaits them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Lord predisposed the bees to make their hives in mountains, trees and trellices,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is God who creates you, then makes you die; and some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they had known before. God is indeed all - knowing and all - powerful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has given you homes to live in, and tents (made) from the hides of cattle convenient for days of travelling and halting; and from their wool and fur and hair you make domestic articles and goods that last a certain time.

The day We shall call a witness from every people, the unbelievers will not be allowed to make excuses.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day We shall call a witness from every people, the unbelievers will not be allowed to make excuses.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remind them of the Day when We shall call from every people a witness against them, and make you a witness over them, for We have revealed to you the Book as an exposition of everything, and as guidance and grace and happy tidings for those who submit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fulfil your covenant with God, having made the covenant, and do not break your oaths once you have sworn them, as you have made God a witness over you. Indeed God knows what you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fulfil your covenant with God, having made the covenant, and do not break your oaths once you have sworn them, as you have made God a witness over you. Indeed God knows what you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And do not be like her who untwists her yarn having spun it into durable thread. Do not use your oaths deceitfully because one party has ascendency over you. God surely tries you in this way: He will make it clear to you on the Day of Resurrection what you were differing about.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If God had pleased He would surely have made you a single community of belief; but He leads whosoever He wills astray, and guides whosoever He please. But you will surely be questioned about what you used to do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So do not make your oaths a means of deceiving one another, lest your foot should slip after having found its hold, and you taste of evil for having hindered (others) from the way of God, and suffer a grievous punishment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When We replace a message with another - - and God knows best what He reveals - - they say: "You have made it up;" yet most of them do not know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whosoever denies having once believed - - unless he is forced to do so while his heart enjoys the peace of faith - - and opens his mind to disbelief will suffer the wrath of God. Their punishment will be great,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not utter the lies your tongues make up: "This is lawful, and this is forbidden," in order to impute lies to God; for they who impute lies to God will not find fulfilment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Endure with patience, for your endurance is not without the help of God. Do not grieve for them, and do not be distressed by their plots.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We gave Moses the Book, and made it a guidance for the children of Israel that they should not take another protector apart from Me.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have created night and day as two signs, then We efface the sign of the night, and make the sign of the day resplendent that you may seek the bounty of your Lord, and know the computation of years and numbers. We have expounded most distinctly everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And do not touch the property of the orphans except for bettering it, until they come of age; and fulfil the promise made: You will surely be questioned about the promise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing could stop Us from sending signs except that the earlier people had rejected them as lies. We sent to Thamud the she - camel as a token to make it clear to them, but they treated her cruelly; and We send signs only to deter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(And) said: "Look! This is what you have honoured above me! If You defer (my term) till the Day of Resurrection, I will bring his progeny into complete subjugation, barring a few."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mislead any of them you may with your voice, attack them with your cavalry and soldiers on foot, share their wealth and children with them, and make promises to them. "- - But the promises of Satan are nothing but deceit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In that case We would have made you taste a double anguish of life and a double anguish of death, and then you would not have been able to find a helper against Us for yourself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Say: "Surely if men and jinns get together to produce the like of this (Qur 'an), they will not be able to produce the like of it, however they might assist one another.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "Surely if men and jinns get together to produce the like of this (Qur 'an), they will not be able to produce the like of it, however they might assist one another.

And say: "We will not believe you until you make a spring of water gush forth from the earth for us;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or, let chunks of sky fall over us, as you assert (you will); or, bring God and the angels as a surety;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He is guided whom God guides. As for him He allows to go astray, you will not find a protector other than Him. We shall raise them on the Day of Resurrection in their own image, blind and dumb and deaf: Their habitation will be Hell. Every time (its fire) subsides We will intensify its flame.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
After this We told the children of Israel: "Dwell in the land. When the promise of reckoning comes, We shall bring you together from a motley crowd.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And say: "All praise be to God who has neither begotten a son nor has a partner in His kingdom; nor has He need of any one to protect Him from ignominy. So extol Him by extolling His majesty."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And that it may warn those who say: "God has begotten a son."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have made whatever exists on the earth its adornment to test and try them (and) know who acts better;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may have thought that they were awake, yet they were asleep. We made them turn right and left, while their dog lay with his forelegs stretched across the threshold. If you had looked at them you would have surely turned away and fled with horror at the sight.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even so We roused them that they may question one another. One of them asked: "How long have you stayed here?" They said: "A day or less than a day." "Your Lord knows best," they said, "how long you have stayed. So send one of you to the town with this money of yours to look for wholesome food and bring it for you; but he should be careful not to let your presence known.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If they come to know of you they will stone you to death, or force you to go back to their creed; then you will never succeed. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Without (adding), "if God may please;" and think of your Lord in ease you forget, and say: "Perhaps my Lord will show me a nearer way to rectitude."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Persevere with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His magnificence. Do not turn your eyes away from them, seeking the splendours of this world, and do not follow him whose heart We have made oblivious to Our remembrance, who follows his own lust and exceeds the bound.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "The truth is from your Lord: So believe if you like, or do not believe if you will." We have prepared for the sinners a fire which will envelope them in its tent. If they ask for water they will be helped to liquid like molten brass that would scald their mouths. How evil the drink, and evil the resting - place!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But surely We do not let the reward of those who believe and do the right to go waste.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There will be gardens of Eden for them, with rivers flowing by, where they will be decked in bracelets of gold, with silken robes of green and of brocades to wear, reclining on couches. How excellent the guerdon, and excellent the resting - place!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each of the gardens yielded its fruit and did not withhold the least; and We made a stream flow in between them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And he walked into his garden, and, (forgetting) his limit, said: "I cannot imagine that this will ever be ruined,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He had no body to help him other than God, nor was he able to save himself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Present to them the example of the life of this world so like the water We send down from the skies that mingles with the earth to nourish its vegetation, which then on the morrow turns to stubble and is blown away by the wind. God has power over everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day We shall move the mountains, and you see the earth an open plain, We shall gather them together, leaving none behind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation. I would not take as helpers those who lead (men) astray.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day He will say: "Call those you had called My compeers," they will call them, but will get no response, and We shall place a gulf between them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We never send apostles but to convey happy tidings, and to warn. But those who disbelieve contend with false arguments to nullify the truth. They make a mockery of My revelations and of what they had been warned.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who is more unjust than he who, on being reminded of his Lord 's revelations, turns away from them, and forgets the evil deeds he had committed in the past. Verily We have placed a covering on their hearts so that they do not understand, and a deafness in their ears so that however you may call them to guidance they will never be guided aright.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they reached the confluence they forgot the fish (they had brought as food) which swiftly made its way into the sea.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they reached the confluence they forgot the fish (they had brought as food) which swiftly made its way into the sea.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He said: "You see, I forgot the fish on the rock where we had stopped. Only Satan made me forget to mention this; but the wonder is the fish escaped to the sea."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He said: "You see, I forgot the fish on the rock where we had stopped. Only Satan made me forget to mention this; but the wonder is the fish escaped to the sea."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So they set out till they (came to the quay) and went on board a ship in which he made a hole, (and Moses said:) "You have made a hole in the boat to drown its passengers? You have done a strange thing!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So they set out till they (came to the quay) and went on board a ship in which he made a hole, (and Moses said:) "You have made a hole in the boat to drown its passengers? You have done a strange thing!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Moses) said: "Do not hold me for having forgotten, and do not reprove me and make my task difficult."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Moses) said: "Do not hold me for having forgotten, and do not reprove me and make my task difficult."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That boat belonged to poor people who used to toil on the sea. I damaged it because there was a king after them who used to seize every ship by force.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But he who believes and does the right will have an excellent reward, and we shall make things easy for him. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He said: "The ability my Lord has given me is better. So help me with your manual labour; I will build a wall between you and them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bring me ingots of iron, "(which they did) until the space between two mountain sides was filled up." Blow your bellows, "he said; (and they blew) until it was red hot." Bring me molten brass, "he said," that I may pour over it. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We shall leave them on that day surging like waves pressing one against the other, and the trumpet blast will be sounded, when We shall gather them all together.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do the unbelievers think they can make My own creatures their protectors against Me? We have prepared Hell for the hospitality of infidels.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who will be heir to me, and heir to the house of Jacob; and make him obedient to You, O Lord. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He said: "Thus will it be. Your Lord said: 'It is easy for Me,' and that: 'We shall make him a sign for men and a blessing from Us.' This is a thing already decreed."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The birth pangs led her to the trunk of a date - palm tree. "Would that I had died before this," she said, "and become a thing forgotten, unremembered."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then (a voice) called to her from below: "Grieve not; your Lord has made a rivulet gush forth right below you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then (a voice) called to her from below: "Grieve not; your Lord has made a rivulet gush forth right below you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I am a servant of God," he answered. "He has given me a Book and made me a prophet,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And be dutiful to my mother. He has not made me haughty or rebellious.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus, when he left them and the (idols) they worshipped, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and made each of them a prophet,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We do not come down," (will the angels say) "but only by your Lord 's command." To Him belongs whatever lies before us and behind us, and the space in between. Your Lord does not ever forget:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
By your Lord, We shall gather them and the devils together, then bring them crawling on their knees around Hell.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is not one among you who will not reach it. Your Lord has made this incumbent on Himself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They say: "God has begotten a son."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We have made this (Qur 'an) easy in your tongue that you may give good news to those who take heed, and warn the people who are contentious.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So do not let those who do not believe in it and follow their vain desires, turn you away from it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And make my mission easy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So go to him and say: 'The two of us have indeed been sent by your Lord. So let the children of Israel come with us, and do not oppress them. We have come to you with a token from your Lord. Peace on him who follows the way of guidance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Moses) replied: "Knowledge of that is with my Lord (recorded) in the Book. My Lord neither errs nor forgets."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made the earth a bed for you, and traced for you paths upon it, and sends down water from the sky, and brings out through it every kind of vegetation

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made the earth a bed for you, and traced for you paths upon it, and sends down water from the sky, and brings out through it every kind of vegetation

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We shall certainly meet you with like magic. So make an appointment when we and you could meet on common ground, which neither we nor you should fail to keep. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Said (Moses): "Let your meeting be on the day of the Feast, and let people assemble in broad daylight."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throw down what is in your right hand: It will swallow up what they have conjured. For what they have fashioned is only a trick of the sorcerer; and a sorcerer does not succeed wherever he may come. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have certainly come to believe in our Lord that He may forgive our trespasses and the magic you have forced us to perform, for God is nobler and abiding. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and made a covenant with you on the right side of the Mount, and sent down for you manna and quails,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What made you hurry away, O Moses, from your people? "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Moses returned to his people full of anger and regret. "O my people," he said, "did not your Lord make you a better promise? Did the time of covenant seem too long to you? Or did you wish the wrath of your Lord to fall upon you that you broke the promise you had made to me?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Moses returned to his people full of anger and regret. "O my people," he said, "did not your Lord make you a better promise? Did the time of covenant seem too long to you? Or did you wish the wrath of your Lord to fall upon you that you broke the promise you had made to me?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They said: "We did not break our promise to you of our own will, but we were made to carry the loads of ornaments belonging to the people, which we threw (into the fire), and so did Sameri.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exalted then be God, the real King; and do not try to anticipate the Qur 'an before the completion of its revelation, but pray: "O Lord, give me greater knowledge."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We said; "O Adam, he is truly your enemy and your wife 's. Do not let him have you turned out of Paradise and come to grief.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(And) said: "Go down hence together, one the enemy of the other. Then will guidance come to you from Me; and whoever follows My direction will neither be disgraced nor be miserable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We did not make their bodies immune to hunger, nor were they immortal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then We made Our promise good to them and delivered whomsoever We pleased, and destroyed the transgressors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And this remained their lament till We mowed them down and made them extinct.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If We had pleased to make a plaything We could have made it Ourself, if We had cared to do so.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If We had pleased to make a plaything We could have made it Ourself, if We had cared to do so.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And yet they say: "Ar - Rahman has begotten a son." Too exalted is He! In fact, those (they call His sons) were His honoured votaries.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not these unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were an integrated mass, then We split them and made every living thing from water? Will they not believe even then?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We made the sky a well - protected roof. Still they turn away from His signs!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But when the unbelievers see you they make fun of you (and say): "Is this the one who mentions your gods (deridingly)?" Yet in Ar - Rahman they disbelieve!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Man is made of inordinate haste. We will show you Our signs, then you will not desire to hasten (the punishment).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If only the unbelievers could apprehend the moment when they would neither be able to ward off the fire from their faces and their backs, nor help reach them!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or do they have lords of their own besides Us who can defend them? But they are not able to help themselves, nor can they find protection against Us.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We allowed them and their fathers time to enjoy till the very end of their lives. Do they not see Us advancing into the land, reducing its frontiers? Would they still prevail?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They wished to entrap him, but We made them greater losers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We bestowed on him Isaac, and Jacob as an additional gift, and made them righteous.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We made them leaders to guide (the people) by Our command; and We inspired them to perform good deeds and observe their moral obligations and pay the zakat; and they obeyed Us.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We helped him against the people who rejected Our signs as lies. They were a wicked people indeed, so We drowned them one and all.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made Solomon understand the case, and bestowed on each wisdom and knowledge, We subdued the al - jibal (mountains) with David to sing Our praises, and at - tair (birds). It is We who did it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made tempestuous winds obedient to Solomon which blew swiftly to sail at his bidding (with his ships) to the land We had blessed. We are cognisant of everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And many of the devils (We also made obedient to him) who dived for him, and did many other things; and We kept watch over them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Remember) her who preserved her chastity, into whom We breathed a new life from Us, and made her and her son a token for mankind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verily you and those you worship other than God will be faggots for Hell; and come to it you will.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Judge in truth (between us), O Lord," he said. "Our Lord is merciful, whose help we seek against what you attribute."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day you see it every suckling female will forget her suckling, and every pregnant female will discharge her burden. You will see men drunk, yet it will not be intoxication. The torment of God will be severe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have any doubt, O men, about being raised to life again, (remember) that We created you from dust, then a drop of semen, then an embryo, then a chewed up lump of flesh shaped and shapeless, that We may reveal (the various steps) to you. We keep what We please in the womb for a certain time, then you come out as a child, then reach the prime of age. Some of you die, some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they knew, having known it once. You see the earth all withered, then We send down rain upon it, and it bestirs itself, swells, and brings forth every kind of beauteous verdure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Turning their backs that they may lead away from the path of God. For such there is disgrace in the world, and on the Day of Judgement We shall make them taste the torment of burning.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He who thinks that God will not help him in this world and the next should stretch a rope to the sky then cut it off and see if his mind is relieved (of doubts) by this stratagem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God will surely admit those who believe and do the right to gardens with rivers running by, where they will be decked in bracelets of gold and of pearls; and of silk will be their garments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let them then attend to their persons and complete the rites of pilgrimage, fulfil their vows and circuit round the ancient House.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apart from this, whoever respects the sacred ordinances of God, will find a better reward for him with his Lord. You are allowed to eat all cattle except those already mentioned to you. Avoid the repugnance of idols, and false and frivolous talk.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have made the camels signs of God for you. There is good for you in this. So pronounce the name of God over them as they stand with their forefeet in a line. When they have fallen (slaughtered) on their sides, eat of (their meat) and feed those who are content with little, and those who supplicate. That is why We have brought them under your subjugation so that you may be grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Permission is granted those (to take up arms) who fight because they were oppressed. God is certainly able to give help to those

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who were driven away from their homes for no other reason than they said: "Our Lord is God." And if God had not restrained some men through some others, monastries, churches, synagogues and mosques, where the name of God is honoured most, would have been razed. God will surely help those who help Him, - - verily God is all - powerful and all - mighty, - -

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the people of Midian too. Moses was also accused of lies. So I allowed the infidels respite and then seized them. How was My reprobation then!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many a habitation given to wickedness have We destroyed, whose roofs tumbled down, which fell into ruins. How many a well and fortress reinforced lie abandoned!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is in order to make the interpolations of Satan a test for those whose hearts are diseased and hardened: Surely the sinners have gone far in dissent.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whosoever retaliates to the extent of injury suffered by him, and is wronged again, will certainly be helped by God. Verily God is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who gives you life, then makes you die; then He will bring you back to life again. Man is surely most ungrateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yet they worship in place of God that for which no authority has been sent to them, and of which they have no knowledge. The wicked will have none to help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O men, give ear to this parable: Those you worship other than God can never create as much as a fly, even if they get together to do so; and if the fly were to rob them of a thing they would not be able to snatch it away from it. How weak the seeker and how weak the sought!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strive in the way of God with a service worthy of Him. He has chosen you and laid no hardship on you in the way of faith, the faith of your forbear Abraham. He named you Muslim earlier, and in this (Qur 'an), in order that the Prophet be witness over you, and you be witness over mankind. So be firm in devotion, pay the zakat, and hold on firmly to God. He is your friend: How excellent a friend is He, how excellent a helper!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made several highways one over the other above you. We are not neglectful of creation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"O my Lord," prayed (Noah), "help me against them, for they accuse me of lies."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then We sent Our apostles one after the other. Every time an apostle came to a people they denied him. So We made one follow the other (to its doom), and turned them into bygone tales. Cursed be the people who do not believe!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and gave them shelter on an elevated ground, sequestered, watered by a spring.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So that when We seize the affluent among them with affliction, they will begin to implore for help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Do not supplicate for help today; you will not be rescued by Us;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has not begotten a son, nor is there any god besides Him. Had this been so, each god would have taken away what he had created with him, and some would have risen over the others. God is much too glorious for what they attribute (to Him)!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "O Lord, if I am made to see what has been promised them,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have certainly the power to make you see what We have promised them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But you ridiculed them. So much so that out of (spite) for them you forgot to remember Me and laughed at them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WE HAVE REVEALED this Surah and made it obligatory as We have sent down clear injunctions in it that you may be warned.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, do not follow in the footsteps of Satan, for he who follows in the footsteps of Satan will be induced by him to what is shameful and forbidden. But for the grace of God and His mercy upon you none of you would have escaped undefiled; but God makes whosoever He will grow in goodness, for God is all - hearing and all - knowing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tell the believing women to lower their eyes, guard their private parts, and not display their charms except what is apparent outwardly, and cover their bosoms with their veils and not to show their finery except to their husbands or their fathers or fathers - in - law, their sons or step - sons, brothers, or their brothers' and sisters' sons, or their women attendants or captives, or male attendants who do not have any need (for women), or boys not yet aware of sex. They should not walk stamping their feet lest they make known what they hide of their Ornaments. O believers, turn to God, every one of you, so that you may be successful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who cannot afford to marry should abstain from what is unlawful until God enriches them by His grace. And free those slaves you possess who wish to buy their freedom after a written undertaking, if you know they have some goodness, and give them out of the riches God has given you. Do not force your maids to prostitution if they wish to lead married lives, in order to get the benefits of this world. But if someone forces them, surely God (will forgive them) after their forced helplessness, for He is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The light is lit) in houses of worship which God has allowed to be raised, and His name remembered in them. His praises are sung there morning and evening,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you not seen that God drives the clouds, then joins them together and puts them fold on fold. Then you see the rain fall through them; and He sends down hail from the sky where there are mountains of it, and strikes those with it whom He will, and wards it off from whomsoever He please. His lightning could snatch away their eyes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has promised to make those of you who believe and do the right, leaders in the land, as He had made those before them, and will establish their faith which He has chosen for them and change their fear into security. They will worship Me and not associate any one with Me. But those who disbelieve after this will be reprobates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, let your dependants and those who have not yet reached the age of puberty, ask permission (to enter your presence) on three occasions: Before the early morning prayer; when you disrobe for the mid - day siesta; and after prayer at night. These are the three occasions of dishabille for you. There is no harm if you or they visit one another at other times (without permission). God thus explains things to you clearly, for God is all - knowing and all - wise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no harm in your eating together or separately. But when you enter the houses, salute the inmates with a greeting in the name of God, invoking blessings and good health. That is how God explains things to you clearly so that you may understand. They alone are true believers who believe in God and His Apostle, and when they are with him on a matter of common concern, do not depart without obtaining his leave. Surely those who ask leave of you are the ones who believe in God and His Apostle. Therefore when they ask leave of you for personal business give leave to those you please, and seek God 's forgiveness for them. Surely God is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not consider your being summoned by the Apostle to be like your summoning one another. God knows those of you who go away surreptitiously. So let those who act in contravention of his command take heed lest a trial should befall them or a grievous punishment come upon them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, who has neither begotten a son nor has He a partner in His kingdom, (who) created everything and determined its exact measure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blessed be He who, if He pleased, could give you better than that, - - gardens with rivers flowing by; and make palaces for you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And when they are cast within a narrow space of it chained together, they would plead for death.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day He will gather them together along with those they worshipped other than God, He will ask them: "Did you lure these creatures of Mine away, or did they themselves go astray?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will answer: "Glory to You. It was not worthy of us to seek any protector other than You. But You allowed them and their fathers a life of ease until they turned oblivious of the Reminder. They were a people impenitent.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The idolaters will be told): "Your gods have refuted your assertion. You can neither avert (your doom) nor receive any help. We shall make the wicked among you taste of severe punishment."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The idolaters will be told): "Your gods have refuted your assertion. You can neither avert (your doom) nor receive any help. We shall make the wicked among you taste of severe punishment."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We never sent before you apostles who did not eat food and walk the market places. We make some of you the means of trying the others. So will you persevere? Your Lord is always watching.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus do We keep opponents among the sinners for every apostle; yet your Lord is sufficient as a guide and helper.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We gave Moses the Book, and made his brother Aaron his minister,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then We told them: "Go to the people who have rejected Our signs." Then We annihilated them completely.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We administered warnings to each of them, and then destroyed them completely.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you not seen how your Lord lengthens out the shadow? He could have kept it motionless if He liked. Yet We make the sun its pilot to show the way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made the night a covering for you; and made sleep for rest, the day for rising.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made the night a covering for you; and made sleep for rest, the day for rising.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made two bodies of water flow side by side, one fresh (and) sweet, the other brine (and) bitter, and has placed an interstice, a barrier between them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is He who made the night and day an alternation for him who cares to reflect and be grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And those who say: "O Lord, give us comfort in our spouses and children, and make us paragons of those who follow the straight path."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I ran away from you out of fear. But my Lord has given me wisdom, and made me an apostle.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then Moses threw down his staff, and lo, it swallowed up their conjurations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We made them leave the gardens and springs of water,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus it was; and We made the children of Israel possess them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the two forces drew within seeing distance of each other, the people of Moses said: "We shall certainly be overtaken."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who will make me die, then give me life again,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And Hell made visible to those who had gone astray.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Together with the hordes of Iblis.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And whenever you apply force become tyrannical.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leaving the consorts your Lord has made for you? But you are a people who exceed the bounds. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But in case you are speaking the truth, then make a segment of the sky to fall upon us. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just think: If We let them enjoy (the good things of life) for a few years more,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who watches you when you get up,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We make their deeds attractive to those who do not believe in the Hereafter, so that they may wander in perplexity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Except those who do some wrong but afterwards do good to make up for the wrong. And I am forgiving and merciful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I found that she and her people worship the sun in place of God, for Satan has made their deeds look attractive to them and has turned them away from the Path, so they do not find the way

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Take this letter from me, and deliver it to them and withdraw, then see what reply they give in return. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The Queen said): "O nobles, a venerable letter has been delivered to me.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But one who had knowledge of the letter, said: "I will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye." When Solomon saw it before him, (he said): "This is by the grace of my Lord that He may test me whether I am grateful or I am thankless. Yet if one is grateful, he is grateful for himself, and if one is thankless, then surely my Lord is unconcerned and magnanimous."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who created the heavens and the earth, who sends down water from the sky for you, with which He causes graceful gardens to grow? It was not in your power to make trees germinate. Is there any other god along with God. In fact they are a people who turn away (from the truth).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who then made the earth a habitable place, and made the rivers (flow) in its valleys and dales, and placed upon it firm stabilisers, and kept a barrier between two bodies of water? Is there any other god along with God? In reality most of them do not know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who hears the cry of the anguished (soul) when it calls to Him, and relieves its suffering? And who made you trustees on the earth? Is there any other god along with God? How little it is that you reflect!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You cannot make the dead to listen, or the deaf to hear the call, when they have turned their backs,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nor can you lead the blind when they have gone astray. You can make none hear except those who believe in Our signs and have come to peace and submission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do they not see that We made the night for them to rest, the day to make things clear? Indeed there are signs in this for people who believe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do they not see that We made the night for them to rest, the day to make things clear? Indeed there are signs in this for people who believe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We wished to favour those who were weak in the land and make them leaders and heirs,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And establish them in the country; and to make the Pharaoh, Haman and their hordes beware of what they feared from them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We conveyed to the mother of Moses: "Suckle him. If you are afraid for him, cast him in the river without any fear or regret, for We shall restore him to you, and make him an apostle."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made (Moses) refuse a wet nurse. So his sister said: "Should I tell you of a household that could bring him up for you and take care of him?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He came to the city when the people were in a care - free mood, and saw two men quarrelling, one belonging to his community, the other to his enemies. The man who belonged to his community appealed for help against the one who belonged to the enemies. Moses struck him a blow with his fist and finished him off. "This is of Satan 's doing," he said. "He is certainly an enemy and a corrupter."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the morning he came to the city, fearful and hesitant. Just then he who had asked him for help the day before called out for help (again). "You are indeed a meddlesome fellow," Moses said to him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the morning he came to the city, fearful and hesitant. Just then he who had asked him for help the day before called out for help (again). "You are indeed a meddlesome fellow," Moses said to him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then as he was about to lay hands on the one who was their common enemy, he cried out: "O Moses, do you want to kill me as you killed that person yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and no peacemaker."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So send my brother Aaron with me as helper for he is more fluent than I with words, that he should affirm me, for I fear that they would call me a liar. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made them the leaders of those who call to Hell; and on the Day of Judgement they will not be helped.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made them the leaders of those who call to Hell; and on the Day of Judgement they will not be helped.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They say: "If we followed your guidance we would be driven from the land by force." Have We not set up a sanctuary for them, to which is brought a wealth of everything as provision from Us? But most of them do not understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whatsoever has been given you is the stuff this life is made of, and only its embellishment. What is with your Lord is better and abiding. Will you not understand?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "Just think. If God were to make the day perpetual till the Day of Resurrection, what other god but God would bring you night for rest? Why do you not reflect?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yet in His benevolence He made you night and day that you may rest and seek His bounty during them, and haply maybe grateful. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So seek the abode of the Hereafter through what God has given you, and do not forget your part in this world. Do good to others as God has done good to you, and do not try to spread corruption in the land. Surely God does not like corrupters. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We opened up the earth and sunk him and his mansion. There was not a body that could help him against (the will) of God, nor was he able to save himself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who were envious of his position only yesterday said on the morrow: "Indeed God increases the fortunes of those of His creatures as He will, and decreases. Had God not been gracious to us He could have (opened up) the earth and made it swallow us. Surely the infidels will not succeed."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those who were envious of his position only yesterday said on the morrow: "Indeed God increases the fortunes of those of His creatures as He will, and decreases. Had God not been gracious to us He could have (opened up) the earth and made it swallow us. Surely the infidels will not succeed."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You did not expect that the Book would be given to you except by the favour of your Lord. So do not be the helper of unbelievers,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nor should you let them turn you away from the commandments of God once they have been delivered to you; and call them to your Lord, and do not be an idolater,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do men think they will get away by saying: "We believe," and will not be tried?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do those who do evil think that they will get the better of Us? How bad is the judgement that they make!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do those who do evil think that they will get the better of Us? How bad is the judgement that they make!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents; but if they try to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them. You have to come back to Us, when I will tell you what you used to do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are among men those who say: "We believe in God;" yet if they happen to suffer in the cause of God they take oppression by men as punishment from God. And if help comes to them from your Lord, they say: "We were with you." Does not God know what is hidden in the hearts of men?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But We saved him and those with him in the ark, and made it a sign for the creatures of the world.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Escape Him you cannot either in the earth or in the sky; and you have no friend or helper apart from God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He said: "You have taken to idols through mutual affection in this life, in place of God, but on the Day of Resurrection you will disown and curse each other, and your abode will be Hell, and you will have none to help you."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You commit unnatural acts with men and cut off the way (of procreation), and commit obscenities in your gatherings. "The only answer his people made was:" Bring the punishment of God, if you are truthful. "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"O Lord, help me against the wicked people," (Lot) prayed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And (remember) 'Ad and Thamud. It will be clear to you from their habitations (how they were destroyed), for Satan had made their deeds look attractive to them, and turned them away from the path; and yet they were a people of acumen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the help of God. He helps whom He will; He is all - mighty, ever - merciful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the help of God. He helps whom He will; He is all - mighty, ever - merciful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore evil was the end of those who did evil, for they denied the signs of God and made fun of them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another of His signs is that He created mates of your own kind of yourselves so that you may get peace of mind from them, and has put love and compassion between you. Verily there are signs in this for those who reflect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And yet the wicked follow their own lusts without understanding. Who can show the way to those whom God allows to go astray? None will they have to help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And yet the wicked follow their own lusts without understanding. Who can show the way to those whom God allows to go astray? None will they have to help them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is God who created you, then gave you sustenance, then He will make you die, and bring you back to life. Is there one among those you associate with Him who can do the least of these things? Too high and exalted is He for what they associate with Him!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Among His signs are the breezes He sends as harbingers of happy news, so that He may allow you to taste of His mercy, and that ships may sail by His command, and you may seek of His bounty, and may haply be grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verily We sent many apostles before you to their people, who brought clear signs with them. Then We retributed those who were sinful. It is a duty incumbent on Us to help the believers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You cannot make the dead to listen nor the deaf hear the call when they have turned back and retreated,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nor can you make the blind see the way when they have gone astray. You can make none hear except those who believe Our signs and have come to submission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nor can you make the blind see the way when they have gone astray. You can make none hear except those who believe Our signs and have come to submission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is God who created you of weakness, then after weakness gave you strength, then after strength will give you weakness and grey hair. Surely He makes whatever He wills. He is all - knowing and all - powerful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Their excuses will be of no avail to the sinners on that day, and they will not be allowed to beg for favour.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So have patience. The promise of God is surely true; and let not those who do not believe make you relax (your endeavours).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So have patience. The promise of God is surely true; and let not those who do not believe make you relax (your endeavours).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If they try to force you to associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. Live with them honourably in the world, but follow the way of him who turns to Me. Your returning is to Me in the end, when I will tell you what you did.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So do not let the unbelief of disbelievers grieve you. They will be brought back to Us, when We shall tell them what they used to do. Whatever is in their hearts is known to God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We let them enjoy themselves only for a while, then We shall drag them to a severe punishment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you not see that God makes the night succeed the day, the day succeed the night? And He has harnessed the sun and the moon so that each runs its appointed course. Surely God is aware of all you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O people, fear your Lord and dread the day when no father will avail a son, nor son his father. Truly the promise of God is true. Do not be deluded by the life of this world, and do not let the deceiver draw you away from God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who made all things He created excellent; and first fashioned man from clay,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then made his offspring from the extract of base fluid,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had We intended We could have given every soul its guidance; but inevitable is My word that I will fill up Hell with men and jinns together.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So now suffer. As you forgot the meeting of this your Day of Doom, so have We forgotten you. Now taste the everlasting punishment for your deeds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So now suffer. As you forgot the meeting of this your Day of Doom, so have We forgotten you. Now taste the everlasting punishment for your deeds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But We shall make them taste the affliction of this world before the greater torment, so that they may retract.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verily We gave Moses the Book; so be not in doubt about his having received it; and We made it a guidance for the children of Israel.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God has not provided two hearts in the breast of a man, nor made your wives, whom you pronounce "mothers" (in order to divorce them), your real mothers, nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. This is only what your lips pronounce. God says what is just, and shows the right way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Call them by the names of their fathers. This is the right course in the sight of God. If you do not know their fathers, they are then your brothers in religion and your friends. It will not be a sin if you make a mistake, unless you do so intentionally; for God is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When We made the covenant with the prophets, and with you, as with Noah and Abraham, Moses and Jesus son of Mary, a binding covenant,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, remember the favours of God to you when an army came against you and We sent a wind against them and forces that you did not see. But God sees all that you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they came upon you from above and below you, when the eyes were stupefied with horror, and hearts jumped to the throats, and you made wild suppositions about God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The faithful were sorely tried there and were shaken completely,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whereas earlier they had made a promise to God that they would never turn their backs; and a promise made to God is answerable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whereas earlier they had made a promise to God that they would never turn their backs; and a promise made to God is answerable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "Who will save you from God if He decide to afflict you or show you His mercy?" They will never find a friend or helper apart from God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Being chary of helping you. But when danger appears you will find them looking at you with eyes turning like a man 's in the swoon of death. Yet when the danger is past they lash you with sharp tongues, covetous of the best (of booty). Such as these have not come to belief. So God nullifies whatever they have done. This is how (the innate law of) God works inevitably.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are men among the faithful who have been true to the covenant they had made with God; and some of them fulfilled their vows (by dying in His cause), and some still wait (prepared for death), and stand firm,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
God drove the unbelievers back in their fury, and they gained no advantage. God was sufficient (to help) the believers in the battle. God is all - powerful and all - mighty.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He made those of the people of the Book who had helped (the tribes) descend from their forts, and filled their hearts with dread, so that you killed some and made many captive;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He made those of the people of the Book who had helped (the tribes) descend from their forts, and filled their hearts with dread, so that you killed some and made many captive;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And He made you inherit their lands and mansions and wealth, and a country you had not traversed before, for God has power over everything.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O Prophet, say to your wives: "In case you desire the life and pomp of this world, come, I will provide you handsomely, and let you go with a grace.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you who believe, when you marry believing women then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the 'waiting period' of them. But provide suitably for them, and let them go with honour.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have made lawful for you, O Prophet, wives to whom you have given their dower, and God - given maids and captives you have married, and the daughters of your father 's brothers and daughters of your father' s sisters, and daughters of your mother 's brothers and sisters, who migrated with you; and a believing woman who offers herself to the Prophet if the Prophet desires to marry her. This is a privilege only for you and not the other believers. We know what We have ordained for them about their wives and maids they possess, so that you may be free of blame, for God is forgiving and kind.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will live in it for ever, and will find no saviour or helper.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We favoured David with excellence, (and commanded): "O Jibal and Tair, glorify the greatness of God with him." And We made iron pliable for him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We (subjugated) the wind to Solomon. Its morning 's journey took one month, and the evening' s one month. We made a spring of molten brass to flow for him; and many jinns laboured for him by the will of his Lord. Anyone of them who turned from Our command was made to taste the torment of blazing fire.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They made for him whatever he wished, synagogues and statues, dishes large as water - troughs, and cauldrons firmly fixed (on ovens; and We said): "O House of David, act, and give thanks." But few among My creatures are thankful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But they turned away. So We let loose on them the inundation of (the dyke of) al - 'Arim, replacing their gardens with two other gardens which bore only bitter gourd, and tamarisks and a few sparse lote - trees.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Between them and the cities We had blessed We placed towns along the highway, and made them stages on their journey, (saying): "Travel between them in safety by day or by night."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But they said: "O Lord, make the distance between the stages of our journeys longer;" but (by doing so) they wronged themselves. So We turned them into bygone tales, and dispersed them, scattered in all directions. Surely there are signs in this for those who endeavour and are grateful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "Call on those you imagine are gods apart from God. They are not masters even of an atom 's weight in the heavens and the earth, nor do they have a share in them, nor is any one of them a helper (of God).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
No intercession avails with Him except his He allows, so that when their hearts are freed of fear, they ask (one another): "What did your Lord say?" They will answer: "What is expedient. He is the all - mighty and supreme."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say: "Our Lord will gather us together and judge between us equitably, for He is the Judge all - knowing."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The unbelievers say: "We do not believe in this Qur 'an, nor in what was (sent) before it." If only you could see the sinners when they are made to stand before their Lord, blaming one another! Those who were weak will say to those who were arrogant: "But for you we would have certainly been believers."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day He will gather all of them together, He will ask the angels: "Did they worship you?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O you people, the promise of God is true. So do not let the life of this world delude you, nor let that (arch) deceiver deceive you about God.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can he, the evil of whose deed is made to look attractive to him so that he considers it good, (be like him who is guided)? God leads whosoever He please astray and guides whosoever He will. So do not waste away your self with grief for them. God is indeed cognisant of things they do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alike are not two bodies of water: This one is sweet and fresh and pleasant to drink, and this one brine and bitter; yet you get fresh meat to eat from both, and take out ornaments to wear. You see how the ships churn through them so that you may seek of His bounty and, perhaps, give thanks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He makes night run into day, the day run into night, and has harnessed the sun and the moon so that each runs to its determined course. This is God your Lord; His is the kingdom; and those you invoke apart from Him are not masters even of the film on a date - palm stone.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
No one who carries a burden bears another 's load; and even if the burdened soul cry out for help none will carry the least of its burden, however close a relative it may be. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in secret and fulfil their devotional obligations. Whoever grows in goodness does so for himself. To God is the journeying back.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equal are not the living and the dead. Verily God makes those He will to listen; but you cannot make those hear who are in their graves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equal are not the living and the dead. Verily God makes those He will to listen; but you cannot make those hear who are in their graves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So We made those of Our creatures whom We had chosen, heirs to the Book; but some of these exceed themselves, and some follow the middle course, and some surpass others in goodness by God 's will, which is the greatest blessing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will enter the gardens of Eden, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and of silk will be their garments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There they will cry for help: "O Lord, get us out that we may do the right, and not what we used to do." Did We not give you a long enough span of life so that he who remembered may reflect? And did not the warner come to you? So now taste (the punishment). The iniquitous will have none to help them.

He is the one who made you trustees on the earth. So he who disbelieves, will bear the consequence of his unbelief. but their unbelief will only increase disgust for unbelievers in the sight of their Lord; and their unbelief will only lead the unbelievers to greater loss.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How my Lord has forgiven me and made me one of those who are honoured! "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alas for men! No apostle ever came to them but they made fun of him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will all be brought together before Us.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have laid out gardens of dates and grapes upon it, and made springs of water flow,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We made similar vessels for them to ride.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We could have drowned them if We pleased, and none would have answered their cry for help, nor would they have been saved,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then they would not be able to make a will, or go back to their people.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whom We made subservient to them so that some of them they ride and some they eat?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And take other gods apart from God that they may perhaps give them help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They will not be able to help them and will be brought (to Us) as their levied troops.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And applies comparisons to Us, having forgotten his origin, and says: "Who can put life into decayed bones?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You say: "Yes; and you will be lowly made."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gather all the wicked together and their comrades, and those they had worshipped

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"What is the matter with you that you do not help each other?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And made his progeny survive,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"When God has created you and what you make?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So they contrived a plot against him, but We made them abject.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And left (his hallowed memory) for posterity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And helped them, so they were victorious.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then he was swallowed by a large fish as he was worthy of blame.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We made a gourd tree grow over him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And they came to believe; so We allowed them to enjoy the good things of life for an age.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or did We make the angels females, and they witnessed it?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"God has begotten (children)?" They are liars indeed!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
